someone who&#39;s been on the show before


you absolutely loved our first episode


together and so I had to have him back


he&#39;s also one of my favorite author is


someone that I&#39;ve been rereading


recently especially when I fell out of


love with learning and I&#39;ll tell you


about that in a second today&#39;s guest is


Robert Green the author of The New York


Times Best Sellers the 48 Laws of Power


The Art of Seduction the 33 strategies


of war the 50th law Mastery the laws of


human nature and most recently of the


daily laws I am so excited to welcome


back to the show Robert Green Robert


thank you for being here thank you so


much for having me J thanks for that


great introduction of course grateful to


have you back in the sea and as I was


just saying to you offline over


Christmas I spent last year touring I


was on stages we did nearly 40 cities


across 90 days my book had come out I


was really pouring out externally and


whenever that happens to me I always


kind of after that get a feeling of I


need to grow again I need to learn again


I need to nourish myself and I really


believe that last


Christmas the daily Laws of Power became


my daily read and I have recommended it


to so many people my wife started


reading it my closest friends have


started reading it and it was just such


a great book for anyone who&#39;s either


stuck with reading someone who&#39;s kind of


like not sure what to read someone who&#39;s


trying to figure out their Direction in


life the daily Laws of Power is a great


starting place I&#39;d say thank you thank


you very much and uh I&#39;ve always been a


your books and you sent me this


beautiful Limited Edition version which


I&#39;m getting to show off on the show uh


but the 48 Laws what a what a phenomenal


book so thank you for being such a big


part of my Learning Journey for having


me you&#39;re a rock star but what a tour


youve been I&#39;ve never been on a tour


like that that sounds like fun it was


fun it was fun we went to Sydney and


Melbourne and Brisbane we went all over


India I went to Dubai I went to W


amsterd Paris Berlin it was phenomenal


like it was amazing would you consider


yourself more of an extrovert or


introvert that so that&#39;s a great


question and I&#39;m going to let you define


the two for me because you&#39;ll probably


have some wisdom to share with us I


energize


alone but I enjoy connecting with small


groups of specific people so I assume


I&#39;m overall an introvert but 99% of


people would say Jay you&#39;re an extrovert


but if I was in a big group of people I


would find the one person who I share


values with to have a deep conversation


I wouldn&#39;t be Milling around introducing


myself everyone so if that makes any


sense but do you need to be alone do you


feel I I crave alone time a lot yes a


lot so you&#39;re a mix yeah you&#39;re a mud


ambiv yeah yeah if that&#39;s what it&#39;s


called yeah am exactly yeah uh but I&#39;ve


so many questions for you Robert that I


want to di into and I&#39;m really coming to


you with questions that I know a lot of


my community and audience repeatedly ask


and I think


you&#39;re specifically positioned to answer


a lot of these the first one I have is


one of the biggest things I get asked is


Jay how do I deal with negative people


how do I deal with negative people in my


family how do I deal with negative


people in my friend Circle how do I deal


with negative people at work in close


intimate circles I feel a lot of people


feel they&#39;re dealing with negativity


well you know it all depends on the


details the kind of negative person


you&#39;re dealing with there there are


several kind of ways of looking at it


some kind of micro in some kind of much


larger the larger picture is we all have


negative traits we all have dark traits


right and so you kind of if you have


this idea that it&#39;s just humans human


beings are like this it&#39;s like a a


flower or a rock or a tree it has its


nature you know I just accept it I


accept people for who they are and I


deal with them on that level I don&#39;t


judge them Etc now of course when you&#39;re


dealing with negative people it can be


very difficult because negative people


like to stir up a lot of drama around


you around them and that&#39;s the kind of


power that they get they like the


attention that they get from making


people upset from pulling on your


emotions right so you have to have you


have to have this kind of larger look at


them where I it&#39;s not about me right


they&#39;re dealing with their own issues


their own problems there&#39;s a history


behind behind it it could be their


parents it could be their family it


could be their spouse their children


whatever and they&#39;re venting it on me in


this particular moment but it&#39;s not


personal I tell people don&#39;t take it


everything so personally right but then


you know so there all these different


levels and it&#39;s it all really depends on


the specifics because a lot of people


come to me for advice but a lot of times


you&#39;re in meshed with a negative person


like it&#39;s your boss it&#39;s your spouse etc


etc and it&#39;s very difficult to do what


I&#39;m talking about right and so you have


to try and get a little bit of distance


from them you have to be able to to say


to yourself um they&#39;re not me right they


have their own problems I&#39;m separate


from them the sense of being separate


from them is very liberating right so


they have issues and they&#39;re trying to


drag me into it and they&#39;re trying to


drag me down but I&#39;m not them I have my


own life and I&#39;m not going to get


involved sometimes you need to have


empathy but sometimes you need to shut


that off and so the best thing in life


though is that&#39;s why I say there&#39;s just


so many angles to approach this from is


if they&#39;re like a deep narcissist and um


that&#39;s probably the most common type of


negative person you deal with in the


world today and we all have come across


this the power that you have is to


recognize people like that before before


you get involved with them and to not


get involved with them right and so they


have signs things that you can pick up


in


advance people who are toxic I don&#39;t


know if we&#39;re going to toxic and


negative are the same here they don&#39;t


show it immediately they&#39;re good at


deceiving you they can be very Charming


they can be very dramatic they pull you


in with their great stories they have


sometimes they&#39;re even charismatic a lot


of important CEOs in the world people


like Elon Musk are raging narcissists


they appear very exciting and you want


to get to know them but you have to


recognize that these are people that are


probably going to use you right they


don&#39;t see you as an individual and the


people you associate with we&#39;re very um


as as humans we&#39;re very open to the


emotions of other people right and so


the people you associate with have a


huge role on who you are and the energy


you have you know your daily life etc


etc and so you have to be very very


careful who you let into your life right


and um God Jay I don&#39;t know there&#39;s so


many different angles to approach it


from no that&#39;s I tell I tell


people that don&#39;t judge people as far as


who are you going to let into your life


don&#39;t be um deceived by the appearances


don&#39;t judge people based on their


Intelligence on their charm on whether


they&#39;re good or bad Etc judge them on


their character whether they have a weak


or a strong character what are some of


the signals the signs we can look out


for because I think what you just said


is so true that we naturally get


attracted to people&#39;s appearance


intelligence


Charisma access because we haven&#39;t


really been trained to view character


yeah so I remember when I lived in the


monastery the highest quality or


character trait that was


considered the epitome


of internal emotional Evolution was


humility and so when you met someone who


was humble and you met someone who


didn&#39;t have false ego they were


considered of High character and we were


trained in order to understand that but


in the modern world that isn&#39;t how the


material world Works we&#39;re almost


attracted to people who can come off


arrogant and showboy


and and even if we sense we don&#39;t like


that we still believe that person has


power and so what are things that we


have to look out for well also there are


people who appear to be humble but


they&#39;re not really humble there&#39;s a lot


of people now who feain humility because


it&#39;s seen as a positive trait yes so


humans are born actors and you have to


kind of look behind the mask so I tell


people I I view it as strong or weak


character a strong character is a person


who can take criticism right who can


work with other people right who can


deal with stressful situations who can


handle responsibility and if there


something goes wrong they take I am to


blame for they don&#39;t look at other


people there&#39;s somebody you can rely on


you lean on them and there&#39;s something


there to lean on you can rely on them in


situations a weak character is somebody


who cannot take criticism that is


probably the number one characteristic


the worst trait I think in people and a


definite trait of of negativity is


somebody who can&#39;t take any kind of


criticism right they&#39;re so defensive so


that means they can get away with


anything they can say anything they want


and there there&#39;s there just like a wall


a shell around them right so the ability


in a work situation in a


relationship to um to take criticism and


not and be able to use it


constructively is an incredibly useful


and Powerful trait to me that reveals


strong character


how people handle stress is a really


good sign of their character so in a


work situation people are good at faking


it and and pretending that they&#39;re very


strong but when it gets really stressful


and there&#39;s a lot of pressure on it the


mask falls off and they reveal that they


can&#39;t handle it they&#39;re too weak they&#39;re


reacting to everything they can&#39;t get


out of the moment they&#39;re so impatient


you know and fragile and so the ability


to handle stress shows that somebody has


something strong inside of them right


how they handle power right so when


people are kind of climbing up the


latter in in a group or in a job they


they generally wear they generally try


and pretend like they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re


with with the group but once they have


power that all falls off and they can


become abusive and they feel like they


can get away with any things that they


couldn&#39;t get away with before they treat


people below them miserably Etc so when


people have power how do they handle it


are they responsible do they suddenly


become somebody different or do they


maintain the character that they had


beforehand right what kind of Partners


do they choose do they choose a spouse a


husband a girlfriend Etc somebody that


they can push around somebody that&#39;s


inferior to them so they can feel better


about themselves how do they look when


they&#39;re playing like a game or they&#39;re


in outdoor activities or something that


has nothing to do with work are they so


competitive they have to win at


everything even when it&#39;s like outside


of that kind of environment you know


that those these are kind of traits that


help me sort of Judge a person&#39;s


character yeah and these are often the


things that we either ignore or we


actually let them kind of Fall by the


wayside or or don&#39;t pay enough attention


to them because we think oh no but


they&#39;re so smart and they&#39;re so this and


I wonder how much of that is also like


what what does that say about us that we


often get attracted to the wrong things


within people what does that say about


us does that make us of strong or weak


character I know that uh I tend to be I


tend to get involved with narcissistic


people it&#39;s a weakness of mine right um


and maybe it&#39;s because of my upbringing


and maybe it&#39;s because I feel a kind of


emptiness inside of me and that their


charm and the attention that they tend


to they pretend to give you is kind of


enchanting or casts a spell on you and


it draws you in yes so if you&#39;re dealing


with your own weaknesses and your own


emptiness inside you&#39;re going to be


drawn to people who fill that fill that


up or you&#39;re going to be drawn to causes


and charismatic leaders that pretend to


give you a purpose in your life because


you don&#39;t have a purpose but they have


it for you kind of thing so a lot of it


has to do yeah with ourselves and we&#39;re


attracted to to we&#39;re even attracted to


negative people and uh there are people


who have patterns in their life where


they deliberately choose the wrong the


worst kind of person for them right and


uh over and over and over again because


at least that makes them feel alive at


least the pain of it you know gives them


a sense of Something&#39;s Happ something


dramatic and so they deliberately bring


on those kind of that kind of pain so


it&#39;s complicated yeah um yeah when you


said that often we feel an emptiness


inside and you were saying maybe because


of your upbringing you felt that


emptiness inside as


well have you tried to fill that


emptiness or is there


another solution well uh to me uh it&#39;s


why I wrote the book Mastery um the way


I feel my emptiness and how I&#39;ve done it


for since I was a kid is through my work


and through my ideas and my thinking and


and how I&#39;m constantly looking for uh


new thoughts and new ways of looking at


the world so um I I I find that if I


don&#39;t if I didn&#39;t


have my work as kind of some people


think of work as something that you just


have to do right it&#39;s just a way to get


money but for me it&#39;s a way to to feel


like I&#39;m I&#39;m a human being that I am who


I am I was destined to write these books


and it gives me every day I wake up and


I know this is what I need to accomplish


etc etc um and so I that&#39;s why I read so


many books that&#39;s why I&#39;m so intrigued


by ideas that&#39;s why I&#39;m writing a book


right now about a subject that very much


captivates me because it does feel that


inner kind of emptiness but on the other


hand um


as someone who


meditates and practices a form of Zen


meditation there is a purpose to


emptiness right there it&#39;s it&#39;s not


necessarily good to be always having to


fill things up in your brain like you&#39;re


just pouring food into your system you


know there is something actually kind of


intrinsically beautiful about the idea


that there that there is emptiness that


that I don&#39;t really have a self that


there is actually not that there is no


such thing is a mind actually it&#39;s it&#39;s


an illusion that we create right it&#39;s


something it&#39;s a lang something through


words that we have so that sense of


emptiness that you know I&#39;m I don&#39;t have


an ego or that I&#39;m confronting the world


and I&#39;m just hearing and seeing things


as they are is actually a beautiful


thing so you have to I have to kind of


struggle against this idea of always


having to fill myself up what&#39;s


something you were saying you like


observing humans and Humanity what&#39;s


something that


you&#39;ve observed about humans over time


that surprised you well nothing really


surprises me because um I read a lot of


history and I see that things just keep


repeating over and over and over again I


know though um since I had my stroke and


since I&#39;ve physically weak and there


things I can&#39;t do


anymore I&#39;ve actually noticed that


people respond to me differently and


it&#39;s actually very positive so sometimes


I can be very negative about people


that&#39;s kind of my inclination that&#39;s how


I&#39;m my mind tends to work which is not


necessarily a good thing we all have


these attitudes that make us look at the


world a certain way I tend to have a


negative bent towards human nature but I


must say people have been very very kind


to me since I&#39;ve had my stroke and it&#39;s


a it&#39;s sad that you have to have an


accident like that to be able to


perceive it but I&#39;ve seen another side


where everyone wants to help me they


kind of empathize with the fact that I&#39;m


a little bit helpless in these


situations and um it&#39;s also made me kind


of feel differently about other people


who have disabilities or things that


they can&#39;t help in their lives but the


sense of I&#39;m a little bit helpless and


people are really eager to try and help


me actually is something that has kind


of surprised me in a way yeah I I liked


what you said there that it&#39;s it&#39;s sad


that someone has to go through something


for us to then show that sides of


ourselves which means that it&#39;s always


there it means that it exists inherently


within us yeah do you think it&#39;s because


we why why do you think that is why why


do you think that is that if it&#39;s


inherently there we don&#39;t display it at


all times to all people I don&#39;t know um


I mean we&#39;re all born with a capacity


for empathy it&#39;s something that


interests me a lot because


uh the feeling that I&#39;m connecting very


deeply to another person let&#39;s say my


wife Etc is a very overpowering emotion


it me gets me out of myself and I&#39;m


seeing the world through her eyes as


opposed to me always projecting myself


onto her it&#39;s a very moving experience


and sometimes you go to a movie and you


find yourself getting inside the


characters you&#39;re getting outside of


yourself and you&#39;re feeling this empathy


for them you&#39;re identifying with them


these are all very powerful emotions


right and we all have the capacity for


that but the world we live in is


actually a Machinery to deaden those


those emotions that sense of empathy


right it just puts so much emphasis on


ourselves on our individuality on who we


are our needs you know our the attention


that we want that we deserve we&#39;re so


focused on ourselves that that natural


feeling of wanting to get inside of


another person and you know it&#39;s very


strange Jay because if you think about


it our inner lives are actually quite


boring the same thoughts repeat over and


over and over again the same emotions


the same preoccupations the same


anxieties and other people they&#39;re so


different they have their own worlds


right they&#39;re like a it&#39;s like traveling


to another country so we should actually


be much more Ori oriented towards other


people we should have a natural interest


in their world because it takes us out


of ourselves it&#39;s like therapy but it&#39;s


been deadened by so many things in our


world by social media by the pressures


we&#39;re under by just modern lifestyle and


so that empathetic muscle that everybody


has is kind of


atrophying and yet there&#39;ll be moments


where it kind of Sparks to life and you


feel like God I want that I want more of


that in my life more of that in my world


how do I get it what what would you say


is your most repeated thought on a daily


basis like


um what do I need to do today what&#39;s on


my schedule you know so like I&#39;m


meditating in the morning and I&#39;m trying


to empty my mind and I&#39;m going into


what&#39;s known as a Coan right and um then


these thoughts keep P bubbling up and


they&#39;re so annoying and it makes you


aware of what how the Machinery of your


own mind and so as to answer your


question it&#39;s always like oh did you


remember that you have to uh call this


person this afternoon did you remember


you have to change that reservation do


you remember that you have to do this


that the scheduling things so


unimportant so trivial where I&#39;m trying


to open my mind up to something vast and


important it&#39;s little things like


scheduling and stuff like that then


there&#39;ll be other thoughts that&#39;ll be


repeating you know like if I saw a movie


from it images will keep popping up from


that and such it makes you aware that


you&#39;re not in control of your own mind


right how have you found over time with


meditation and other practices what have


you used in order to


start quietening emptying whatever the


right word is for you releasing those


thoughts so that you can connect with


vastness be creative or


self-express wow it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not easy


and it&#39;s an ongoing process and I could


say I&#39;m maybe 10% of the way where I&#39;d


like to


um but first of all uh you


recognize you go through a thing where a


thought pops up and it&#39;s like why am I


thinking about that I don&#39;t like it you


you realize that it&#39;s just a thought and


what is a thought now I know we&#39;re


getting really weird and metaphysical


here I like it but it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s


not real it&#39;s a phantom right it has no


reality reality is your body the present


moment the birds outside the sky where


you are sitting the fact that you&#39;re


alive that your blood is pumping these


are real but that thought in your mind


is a shadow it&#39;s a phantom it doesn&#39;t


exist it has no reality and so I go to


this process where don&#39;t engage with it


and it&#39;s really weird because then my


mind plays tricks on me and it pulls up


a thought that&#39;s definitely going to


engage me right because it wants that


it&#39;s it&#39;s like a sugar rush and so I go


okay no I&#39;m not going to engage with it


and it made me realize as I went through


that process that this is what social


media is based on social media has


mirrored the human brain on a large


scale we have thoughts that are designed


to grab our emotions and make us think


about them repetitively over and over


again compulsively right and there&#39;s


probably a purpose behind that but


social media is is actually a genius at


that picking at putting up things up


there they&#39;re going to engage our


emotions so we have to pay attention so


I always try and every time that happens


I withdraw and I say it&#39;s just a thought


it&#39;s not real it&#39;s not who I


am this is a very important part of


meditation your thoughts are not who you


are they&#39;re a separate part of yourself


you are something different from your


own thoughts I don&#39;t know if that means


anything to you it does it does


definitely and while we are not our


thoughts and we are not our mind our


thoughts become our reality we find that


a repetitive thought turns into a habit


that turns into a pattern that turns


into an action becomes our reality for


example I am a unorganized lazy


individual usually translates into oh I


forgot to send that it didn&#39;t happen


because now it&#39;s a belief that&#39;s built


up and so it&#39;s so fascinating that


something that&#39;s so not real becomes so


real and and I&#39;ve been really


into seeing how thought editing is so


useful as an activity and an


exercise because I&#39;ve found so many of


my thoughts become my beliefs that


become my life and I think a lot of


people don&#39;t realize because they don&#39;t


realize that their thoughts are like


clothes that you can


change we do believe that our thoughts


are real and our reality and whatever


we&#39;re hearing in our head is exactly


what is and we don&#39;t realize that oh


it&#39;s like looking in your wardrobe and


saying I don&#39;t like the color green


anymore I&#39;m going to change it for blue


right it&#39;s it&#39;s a simple as that well


there was a something I read recently um


in in one of the Buddhist books that I


like to read that said our minds are


basically Topsy Turvy they&#39;re upside


down so the reality is we don&#39;t re I


mean I don&#39;t want to get too deep into


this but we don&#39;t really have a self the


self is a construction of our minds


there actually is nothing there and that


kind of emptiness that egolessness is


Enlightenment it&#39;s a beautiful feeling


and maybe in your life you&#39;ve touched


upon it briefly I know I&#39;ve touched upon


it briefly it&#39;s not the reality I have


every day but that&#39;s the real that&#39;s


real and what&#39;s not real are the


thoughts but everything is turned upside


down in our worlds and so these


delusionary thoughts about of about


people about who I am about my habits


Etc they become our reality when it&#39;s


exactly the opposite right you have to


be able to to be aware of that and so


you know meditation is all about being


aware of is becoming aware of these


things because we walk around like


automatons you know I&#39;m very into this


writer named GFF I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve


ever heard of G he was this um he&#39;s


basically from Armenia he was in the


beginning of the 20th century


he was this man who was very interested


in in mysticism and he traveled


throughout Asia trying to find the the


uh the essence of all the different


esoteric philosophies and he created his


own philosophy and it&#39;s very interesting


very exciting stuff he wrote a book


called in search of the miraculous that


I highly recommend people and it&#39;s not


woo woo stuff he was a very very


practical man he puts it in very


practical terms but his idea is that we


walk around


asleep we&#39;re on automatic pilot


constantly we&#39;re not really aware that


we&#39;re breathing that we&#39;re existing


we&#39;re not aware where our thoughts come


from we&#39;re not aware of how our body


moves etc etc etc and


so it&#39;s a process of slowly becoming


aware of these kinds of things that is


really kind of I&#39;ve been doing this 14


15 years now and it&#39;s really really kind


of changed the course of my life I have


to say


yeah I love that and I can&#39;t wait to


read that book now and I I couldn&#39;t


agree more I


feel we&#39;re so disconnected from our mind


and body that


we constantly believe that someone


outside of our s has the answer for how


we feel and while that may be true when


you&#39;re seeing a doctor or a dentist or


something of that professional


nature we don&#39;t really know how our


body&#39;s been feeling for weeks or months


until it crashes and we&#39;ve realized that


we haven&#39;t paid enough attention to X or


Y or Z or a relationship in the same way


has to end in order for us to realize


that he had lost investment and energy


or whatever it may be and we&#39;re so far


away from the self or at least this


version of the self


that yeah we&#39;re not really aware I love


what you just said about the idea of how


conscious are we of the fact that we&#39;re


breathing we&#39;re here we&#39;re present we&#39;re


together versus how much are we living


up here yeah


and and it&#39;s really interesting isn&#39;t it


because there&#39;s almost two realities


that we&#39;re always dealing and if we&#39;re


getting too heady I&#39;m happy to move away


from it but it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like I&#39;ve


been thinking a lot about how in one


sense what&#39;s out here is real and in one


sense what here isn&#39;t and at the same


time actually what&#39;s going on here is


the real because it defines how I


interact with everything else and and it


can help me be a better a filter a bit a


a Chooser selector of the people I&#39;m


around and the places I visit so you say


you have to kind of use the mind to be


able to become present it&#39;s a process I


would say I&#39;m alluding to that in


Discovery not in pushing it if that


makes sense yeah yeah it makes sense to


me yeah I agree with that definitely


yeah I I&#39;ve been reflecting a lot


recently about


how most of what&#39;s happening is in the


invisible world and that that&#39;s very


interesting tell me more about that so


I&#39;ve just been I was thinking that in in


one sense you have reality


externally the visible


world but how I make sense of that


visible world is all in the invisible


space and ultimately how I make sense of


it is the reality that I experience


regardless of what&#39;s happening around me


which is why we realize that people who


well we all are telling ourselves


stories and narratives all day long


but how we&#39;re processing what we&#39;re


experiencing is our reality as opposed


to the event or what someone said or


social media as you gave an example like


I can either sit here and say like I


know that when I wake up in the morning


and I start scrolling on social media my


mind is now moving 10 times 100 times


faster than if I don&#39;t do that and I


know that brushing my teeth and


showering is a much more peaceful


process


if I haven&#39;t looked at my phone then if


I do right and so that choice is being


made in The Invisible world


and the visible world is simply


something I&#39;m interacting with and


taking from or being affected by well so


we mostly live in amid things that are


invisible yes right symbols Etc yes


language is is is a symbol it&#39;s not


reality and so um things like government


and and and social behavior they&#39;re


rules and codes that we abide by but


they&#39;re not visible they&#39;re invisible


right yeah definitely and and we&#39;re not


aware of that and so we&#39;re trying to


raise our awareness of the invisible


world I&#39;m always trying to raise my


awareness of why do I process this this


way where does this come from where&#39;s


this idea taking root that&#39;s a very yeah


it&#39;s very interesting process to go


through yeah it&#39;s hard it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s


not clear it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like a


here&#39;s step-by-step process it&#39;s just


something I&#39;ve been engaging with a lot


yeah yeah I like to try and um go


through a thing where I I question all


of my beliefs and things of why where


does that come from why do I believe


that why has that become something


that&#39;s so hardened into my brain I


believe that about myself and who I am


about other people I continually try to


challenge it and look at what might be


the source of it and then maybe say it


could be the opposite right and actually


it can be it can lead to a lot of


problems because it&#39;s like my mind is


always swimming and I&#39;m never really


think anything is certain I&#39;m always you


know seeing the opposite side of it but


um I think it&#39;s in the end it&#39;s a very


healthy process how how do you I I love


I love where we&#39;re going because it kind


of comes back to your same point early


sorry your earlier point about how


someone of strong character knows how to


take criticism which means they know how


to deal with the opposite of what they


think or feel and so this idea that


you&#39;re sharing now that it&#39;s healthy to


be able to question to evaluate to


assess our beliefs and values but like


you said it&#39;s one of the hardest things


to do because you get into a space of


uncertainty you question your identity


you lose a sense of direction how do we


question ourselves without losing


ourselves and actually realize that that


is the process of discovering and


building ourselves you know like who who


really are you in the end you know what


what what constitutes you the essence of


you what were you meant to accomplish in


this world right your sense of purpose


you know to use the title of your show


what is it that makes you an individual


makes you unique that you alone are


meant to accomplish in life well it&#39;s


not given we don&#39;t know it and a lot of


people really really struggle with


trying to figure that out right because


they&#39;ve been programmed by their parents


by their siblings by the culture by


their teachers to say this is who you


are this is what you should believe in


this is what you were meant to


accomplish in life this is what&#39;s cool


and what&#39;s not cool okay and so you have


to question yourself you have to say is


this really who I am do I really am I


really interested in this subject am I


really interested in this kind of person


in getting in a relationship with this


kind of person and so question yourself


on that level you&#39;re getting at a deeper


and deeper core of maybe who you are at


essence you you&#39;re cutting away all of


the social stuff that&#39;s been foed upon


you that it has nothing to do with you


right so in some ways you&#39;re kind of a


mystery to yourself and you&#39;re sort of


trying to solve that puzzle and you have


to ask these questions is this something


I&#39;m actually really interested in is


this an intrinsically important thing to


me or is it something that&#39;s in the


culture or something that other people


have told me and questioning that over


and over and over again is not to lead


you into this Abyss where there&#39;s


nothing real is to get you closer to who


you are to what really matters to what


that essence of you is to what you meant


to accomplish in life and once you reach


that that inner kind of gold then you


have you have a degree of certainty so I


know I knew from a very young age that I


wanted to be a writer right I had a


struggle to figure out what kind of


writing I wanted but knowing that&#39;s who


I am probably about about the age of


eight it allowed me to go I&#39;m not


interested in that I don&#39;t want to do


that this isn&#39;t important why am I


following this career path why am I


wasting my time here and then so knowing


that kind of core you don&#39;t have to keep


questioning yourself so I&#39;m never going


to question myself why are you a writer


why are you writing books you should


have been a a pop star you should have


been a rock singer you should have


written poetry you should have been a


lawyer no I&#39;ll never go there because I


have that that firm ground beneath me


and that&#39;s what your questioning is


supposed to lead to get to the essence


of who you are and once you&#39;re there you


have a degree of certainty in your life


yeah it does it does and I feel like a


big challenge something that I&#39;ve been


thinking a lot about lately is a big


challenge of where that comes from


is because we care so much about what


people think and we&#39;re scared of being


an unsuccessful version of


ourselves because we&#39;d rather be a


success version of what someone else


wants us to be yeah and so we&#39;re scared


of being an unsuccessful writer if we


could be a successful accountant we&#39;re


scared of being an unsuccessful artist


because we&#39;d rather be a successful Tech


person whatever else it may be fill in


your blank and because what we think


people think of us has such a strong


hold on us that we can&#39;t pivot to our


passions we can&#39;t maneuver to our


purpose we can&#39;t accept that maybe I&#39;m


not what this person wants me to be and


I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time in this


to try and figure out and I and we let&#39;s


let&#39;s dive into it from different


perspectives but I guess how much Robert


do you care what people think of you and


how have you made sense of that over


your time as someone who obviously


writes that a lot of people enjoy your


reading people may disagree with you


they may agree with you people as said


debate discuss but how have you made


sense of that and what&#39;s been your


process of dealing with how you think


people think about you there&#39;s there how


people think about me who know me


personally and there&#39;s how people think


about me in the social realm who don&#39;t


know me personally and who have an idea


of who I am which is often very


different from the reality but naturally


as a human being I care that people


understand that I&#39;m I&#39;m a certain way


that I have a certain character that I


actually love jokes and silly bathroom


humor and that you know I like stupid


movies and that I&#39;m not always you know


reading heavy philosophy you know my


wife can tell you all about this


childish side of my personality so you


know it&#39;s always been important to me to


feel kind of authentic and


sincere and I&#39;ve always hated and it&#39;s


probably why I wrote the 48 Laws of


Power I hate


people who are pretending to be


something that they&#39;re not deeply deeply


wounds me and I don&#39;t know why I don&#39;t


know why it&#39;s been like that since I was


a child maybe I suspected that in my


parents the kind of


falseness that upsets me deeply and so I


wrote the 48 Laws of Power because I


felt people are such Hypocrites they


pretend that they&#39;re not interested in


power but that&#39;s all they&#39;re interested


in right they wear this front like oh I


just want to help people I just want to


WR make movies and culture and art know


you&#39;re interested hidden power so it&#39;s


always been deeply important to me to


kind of reveal what&#39;s really going on in


someone and to sort of feel that way


about myself so when I don&#39;t feel like


I&#39;m myself when I feel like I&#39;m faking


it and sometimes to be honest with you


Jay being a kind of quote unquote


self-help Guru it feels false it doesn&#39;t


feel like who I am I feel like a bit of


an impostor that&#39;s not really what I


wanted to be relate to that I just


wanted to write books I love ideas I


love thoughts I love expanding my


Consciousness right so the feeling that


I&#39;m not being who I am and that other


people are kind of glomming onto that is


upsetting to me yeah I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m


answering your question no that that&#39;s I


mean that&#39;s resonating so deeply with me


I


think it&#39;s so interesting isn&#39;t it how


your


self-perception is so different from


people&#39;s projection onto you and so I I


can identify with that I do what I do


because I&#39;m just sharing what I love so


I love meditation I love uh wisdom books


I


love Traditions I love ancient wisdom


and modern science and seeing the


parallels between the two and I just


love talking about that and sharing that


yeah and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever thought


of myself as a guru or a guide or a or


that kind of


individual but we in society if someone


shares or teaches or gives Insight or


advice we box them or bucket them as


that so same as you we&#39;d go in the same


bucket even though we kind of do similar


things but very different things and we


probably have some similar interest and


some different interest and it&#39;s


interesting how there isn&#39;t a space like


I often say to people I&#39;m just trying to


be everyone&#39;s spiritual friend like


that&#39;s my goal like I&#39;m that guy who is


introducing my friends to co things that


they may not have come across whether


it&#39;s eastern spirituality or wisdom or


whatever it may be like I&#39;m that guy and


that&#39;s all I want to be I I don&#39;t want


to be anything else right but it&#39;s hard


when you almost get put on a pedestal


even though you didn&#39;t ask for that or


didn&#39;t want that well people&#39;s


perception of you can almost become what


how you perceive yourself if you&#39;re not


careful for sure you know and so um


that&#39;s why I keep coming coming back to


myself and going is that really who I am


yes I don&#39;t think so Robert you know and


also I actually um I&#39;m very I&#39;m a flawed


individ I&#39;m a flawed human being I have


you know blind spots in my nature I have


compulsions that I wish I didn&#39;t have


and I don&#39;t like this idea that people


think I&#39;m this powerful person who&#39;s


figured everything out because I&#39;m not I


have that&#39;s why you know I write the


wrote the book the laws of human nature


it was because I understand that I


shared the same flaws that I have


narcissistic tendencies that I too can


feel envy that I have moments of


grandiosity so I&#39;m not comfortable with


the idea like that I&#39;m this somebody


that I&#39;m not that the perception of me


is but that&#39;s what happens to a lot of


successful famous people they become


trapped in what other people are


thinking about them they become trapped


in that image and I honestly think


I I could be way off base but I&#39;m


thinking of somebody like Anthony


Bourdain who committed suicide I think


he was burdened and weighed down so much


by how people thought of himself and it


wasn&#39;t who he was and it kind of made


him feel deeply uncomfortable I&#39;m sure


there were many other issues going on


but a lot of times it can make you


uncomfortable in your own skin the way


people perceive you and it can lead to


deep feelings of depression and and is


and a loss of Who You Are country yeah


yeah absolutely I mean could write a new


book called the flaws of human nature


it&#39;s like thank you it&#39;s that&#39;s what the


book is it&#39;s the 18 dark corners of


human nature but yeah that&#39;s a good idea


yeah it&#39;s no it&#39;s just a you know a


thought of like it it is true it&#39;s


there&#39;s a seeking of


perfection and there&#39;s a sense that


we&#39;ve created in the world of before and


after in the sense that


if you look at like a a workout program


and there&#39;s nothing wrong with this


because it makes sense but there&#39;s a


before picture and there&#39;s an after


picture and if someone&#39;s wealthy it&#39;s


like they were poor and now they&#39;re rich


and everything&#39;s a linear before and


after journey and what we&#39;re talking


about and I fully agree with you on this


is that actually all of my challenges


are


cyclical and they&#39;re different so it&#39;s


not that I never feel Envy anymore it&#39;s


that I feel it differently to how I felt


it 10 years ago and hopefully I&#39;m a bit


better at dealing with it and


understanding it and and engaging with


it than I was 10 years ago but it&#39;s not


that it doesn&#39;t affect me anymore right


right and same with spiraling thoughts


it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t have anxious or


negative thoughts anymore because I&#39;m


enlightened I still have those thoughts


I just deal with them better than I did


10 years ago and I probably have more


tools to help me engage with them that&#39;s


true that&#39;s very and I think that


cyclical nature nature


is a wonderful thing to accept as an


individual and as someone who&#39;s learning


because you then don&#39;t fool yourself to


think oh there will be one day where I


will no longer have a negative or


anxious thought like Jay and Robert like


you know they probably never have it


it&#39;s like well yeah you I probably have


less but it&#39;s not that I never have them


exactly uh right yeah yeah and so so


that kind of idea of this before and


after I think


is what confuses so many people because


it feels like oh there is a point at


which I never have to go back to being


this version of myself well that life


isn&#39;t like that you know it&#39;s weird


sometimes because before the 48 Laws of


Power came out I was just this nobody


living in a two one-bedroom apartment in


Santa Monica rent controlled you know


never really made any money never really


had any success in life and I was


constantly giving people advice but


nobody would listen to me because I


hadn&#39;t written the book suddenly the


book comes out and I&#39;m supposed to be a


different person you know it&#39;s very


strange but I&#39;m actually the same person


that I was when I was living in that


miserable one-bedroom apartment you know


and giving out my advice that nobody


listened to now people listen to it but


the only difference is because suddenly


I have this credential which is very


strange yeah I I can relate to that so


many ways I was I I used to be mentor


and coaching people in my community I


would do these little events in London


10 11 years ago now where like five


people would show up and and it was you


know I I was just doing it I would speak


at universities for free for years like


I was it was you know it&#39;s been such a


big part of my life to just do this I&#39;ve


always wanted to be someone who&#39;s


learning and sharing that&#39;s what I enjoy


I enjoy learning and I enjoy sharing and


I enjoy synthesizing and making things


simple and practical for other people


that&#39;s that&#39;s what I get my joy from and


I was always inspired by two quotes one


is Ian Pavlov where he said if you want


a new idea read an old book and so


that&#39;s always been something that my


work has been inspired by it&#39;s always


based on ideas that seem Timeless but


they&#39;re and old very beautiful yeah yeah


and then there&#39;s another thought from


Einstein which is another part of what


inspires my work which is if you can&#39;t


explain something simply you don&#39;t


understand it well enough M and so were


the two kind of tenets that what I


enjoyed doing in the world and again I


don&#39;t think they&#39;re magnificent


miraculous or brilliant they&#39;re just


what I&#39;m meant to do uh and there&#39;s such


a


beautiful significance and


insignificance in that very


understanding like it&#39;s really


significant building because I&#39;m like I


know what I have to do and that&#39;s really


insignificant because I&#39;m like it&#39;s just


what I have to do it&#39;s it&#39;s not the best


or the worst or it&#39;s not comparative


right um and I think that&#39;s how when


you&#39;re talking the daily Laws of Power


that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of how in different


words how you describe like your life&#39;s


um you know your life&#39;s gifts your


life&#39;s work your life&#39;s path I&#39;ve always


liked old books myself so um you know I


read a lot of books of philosophy Etc


history but I also read books of famous


Zen


Classics the 20th century books I&#39;m not


so but I&#39;d read like something from the


11th Century where the thought process


is so different but it&#39;s Timeless it&#39;s


human man it is so beautiful it so


Sparks these ideas that he or this


writer this thinker was dealing with the


same things now a thousand years later


but they still strike a truth but it&#39;s


in this language that&#39;s very weird and


primitive and barbaric I don&#39;t know why


that excites me so much it&#39;s the same


idea that a modern writer might write


but put in the words of somebody a


thousand years ago it suddenly touches


me yeah can you explain that Jay I mean


I don&#39;t know I can apart from the fact


that you&#39;ve reincarnated and you had


some connection to it but um can I


explain it I can&#39;t explain it but I can


I can reflect on it I mean I find that


there&#39;s a part of it that that writer or


Creator may never have known if anyone


would ever read it yeah and so that


privacy and that secrecy and that


intimacy with their work not knowing


that it would ever be viewed seen read


broadcasted that has some power to it


yeah yeah there&#39;s a there&#39;s a humility


to that whereas now people WR we&#39;re


expecting all these people to be reading


it we do it for the attention yeah it


was much different back then yeah that&#39;s


very interesting I never thought of that


yeah I&#39;ve I&#39;ve definitely found


that I try and wreath yeah I try and sit


with ideas for longer now and try and


kind of I&#39;d love to know your process


for that how have you managed that since


that moment of where you became quote


unquote successful because externally


because of 48 Laws how did that change


your creative process how did you hold


on to the the roots of this kind of


thinking so after the 48 Laws of Power


came out and it was successful I was at


a turning point in my life and it&#39;s a


turning point that a lot of people I


think have faced was do I just continue


redoing the 48 Laws power was success


uccessful it worked well why don&#39;t I


just write the 48 Laws of Power part two


it&#39;ll bring in money it&#39;ll bring in


attention I&#39;ll just Riff Off what I


wrote there and something about me was


not comfortable with that it seemed


cheap it seemed easy and it seemed lazy


and I know myself that if I&#39;m not


challenged by something


different I grow bored so I have to


write something that feels like there&#39;s


energy behind it there&#39;s anger there&#39;s


love there&#39;s something powerful behind


it I have to feel it or it won&#39;t be in


the words so if I&#39;m just doing the 48


Laws of Power part two it won&#39;t be there


it&#39;ll have an emptiness and damn it a


lot of artists and writers fall into


that trap and it&#39;s why their books kind


of have this sort of hollow ring to them


right they&#39;re just going through the


motions just repeating what worked


before and I can&#39;t stand that feeling I


have to feel like I&#39;m off into a new


land with this new book so each book has


to represent a challenge right and so


the one I&#39;m writing now is completely


different from all seven of the other


books and it&#39;s an incredible challenge


but it makes me excited about every day


because I know I cannot repeat the same


kind of books over and over over again


my soul becomes dead and I have to feel


alive with each project am I answering


your I keep like I&#39;m not answering you


are you&#39;re totally answering my question


I&#39;m loving these personal answers no no


I I can resonate very deeply with that


as well I always try and write about


something that I&#39;m working through or


struggling with whether it&#39;s personal


whether it&#39;s with clients whether it&#39;s


with someone in my life friends family


like it feels alive it needs to feel


alive I can&#39;t write from a point of


theory or knowing yeah like the book has


to be a discovery exactly and I&#39;ve only


just started my I&#39;ve only written two


books but as I&#39;m hearing you I&#39;m I&#39;m


happy to that I feel that I&#39;m thinking


about it in a healthy way yeah because


yeah I was I was about to write my third


book and the topic everyone wanted was


so predictable and expected and it made


sense and I was like I don&#39;t want to


write about something that makes sense


like that&#39;s boring like it&#39;s like I want


to write about something that feels like


alive in my life and electric and makes


me I&#39;m like now that I&#39;ve chosen I will


tell this to you later but I&#39;ve chosen


my next topic and I&#39;ve just been like


writing notes about it I&#39;m reading about


it I&#39;m seeing connections everywhere


that means it&#39;s going to be a great book


yeah it just it feels I mean it&#39;s harder


it&#39;s harder because you don&#39;t know so


you&#39;re spending more time like we said


earlier you&#39;re spending more time with


emptiness because there&#39;s a sense of


well I don&#39;t know which direction this


book&#39;s going to go in yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s


that comfortable with discomfort and


uncertainty yeah but there&#39;s a joy in


that yeah very much so yeah when you&#39;re


when you&#39;re discovering your process


through a book or or work how have you


learned to become comfortable in the


discomfort of creativity


in that like you don&#39;t know where the


path&#39;s going to take you you don&#39;t know


if it&#39;s going to land or not you you


don&#39;t know if it like how how are you


grappling with that process of what


we&#39;re discussing well it&#39;s very strange


um because I&#39;m dealing with it right


this very moment I&#39;m writing something


that&#39;s driving me crazy and it&#39;s this


and the Very subject I&#39;m writing about


is about what I&#39;m going through so I&#39;m


writing it this is in my book on the


sublime and I&#39;m writing about the


concept of the dayon are you familiar


with


that it&#39;s the idea it&#39;s an ancient Greek


idea but it&#39;s in many other cultures


that we have a second self that there&#39;s


something there&#39;s a voice inside of us


that is guiding us to something higher


or better but it can also lead us to


something lower and worse it can be


demonic which is where the word comes


from or it could be something and


Socrates had his Dame on there was a


voice inside of him and it said it


always just said this is the right way


to go or this is the wrong way to go


nothing more than that right and so when


I&#39;m


writing it doesn&#39;t feel right it&#39;s


driving me crazy and I&#39;m going through


this right now it doesn&#39;t feel right it


doesn&#39;t resonate it&#39;s not truth it&#39;s not


real you got to start over you got to do


it again and the back of my mind I&#39;m


thinking God I&#39;ve lost it I&#39;m getting


old and I just don&#39;t have my mojo


anymore but then I realized I&#39;ve gone


through this like 85 times


every single book it&#39;ll come to you


it&#39;ll come back it isn&#39;t right because


it doesn&#39;t feel right it doesn&#39;t


resonate it doesn&#39;t have a reality to it


so I have to go through this process


where I write something and it excites


me and it interests me and it just flows


out of me as opposed to like I have to


pull every word out and so I learned to


trust myself that eventually I&#39;ll figure


it out but each time I hit that wall I


go this is it Robert you&#39;re finished the


book isn&#39;t going to come out you&#39;re done


the wells are dry you know yeah that&#39;s


so interesting I feel like that is every


creative&#39;s Journey like it has to go


through that the wells are dry as you


just said that kind of experience of


that&#39;s it it&#39;s over there&#39;s nothing else


coming out now I&#39;m you know and and it&#39;s


almost like we as as we know like the


cliche of like it&#39;s on the other side of


that feeling but it&#39;s but it&#39;s true


there there is a sense of when


everything is just not making sense how


have you learned to sense whether


something feels true to you because it


obviously felt true to someone how how


do you decipher between oh this feels


true it feels real to me even if people


don&#39;t agree with it because it just


feels that way it&#39;s it&#39;s purely just a


feeling first of all it it like I&#39;m


always trying to get at what&#39;s real and


and not at what&#39;s theoretical I have a


real dislike of abstraction for its own


sake right it feels like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s


it&#39;s a a way of eluding something it&#39;s


it&#39;s it&#39;s an evasion I want to get at


the core in the reality of what I&#39;m


trying to write


about and so when I get it I feel it and


I know that I&#39;ve done that and I and I


have the reader in my mind and I know


the reader can connect to it it&#39;s it&#39;s


going to have a personal appeal whereas


I have a tendency to be abstract and


professorial and theoretical I cross all


of that out you if you saw my notebooks


95% of it&#39;s crossed out and I don&#39;t let


the public ever see that side of me


because I don&#39;t like it I want my books


to feel like I&#39;m I&#39;m hitting something


that&#39;s actually truthful and real that


people don&#39;t like to talk about kind of


thing you know so right now I&#39;m writing


about what is our self what is the sense


of self that we have in our world it&#39;s a


very limited idea of the self we have


very limited idea of our Consciousness


we have a very limited idea of what it


means to be a human being in the 21st


century we&#39;re actually much more immense


and much more interesting than we think


we are we have these possibilities these


connections because we&#39;re a part of


something incredibly vast and to have


Consciousness is absolutely an


astounding thing right so I want to sort


of expand what you the reader thinks of


who you are what yourself is it&#39;s much


larger than you imagine but I have to it


convey that in language that feels right


to me that feels authentic that feels


like


everybody in Africa in China in in India


in Idaho is going to be able to relate


to it you know yeah no no for sure and


that&#39;s I think that&#39;s what I was


alluding to with that invisible World


point of like how that&#39;s what we don&#39;t


see like there&#39;s so much to oursel that


we don&#39;t see that we&#39;re fully unaware of


that we don&#39;t have we don&#39;t realize we


have access to right and yeah it finding


the right terminology I find to be such


a there&#39;s there&#39;s one word that I love


which is a bit more ethereal but I guess


an astronomer could find some beauty in


it but there&#39;s a term in the viic


literature is called anash which means


inner Sky say say it again an Akash an


means inner and Akash means Sky inner


Sky yeah inner Sky beautiful and it&#39;s


this idea of how you know we&#39;re so


fascinated by outer space but there&#39;s


that same inner sky that exists so just


that like the Galaxy and the planetary


systems and everything else that exists


internally too oh I have to but but


there has to be a just as we have to go


and do space exploration yeah you could


do the same internally oh for sure and


you discover so much that&#39;s exactly what


I&#39;m writing about that&#39;s very


interesting yeah and and and it&#39;s yeah


it&#39;s fascinating and so yeah I find


language as well I find vocabulary so


needed and I feel like I grew up with a


smart vocabulary but not the biggest and


I feel reading of course expands that


and especially when you read history and


other books and I found that it&#39;s


language is just so powerful and I I


worry that social media exposes us to


such limited language that the brain and


the mind and the Consciousness doesn&#39;t


have the opportunity to be expansive


because the words don&#39;t allow for it if


we&#39;re all reading the same memes and the


same Trends and the same hashtags and it


it kind of just creates this very very


limited space of Consciousness well


that&#39;s why I like looking at other


languages i&#39; I&#39;ve Speak several other


languages and I&#39;m constantly learning


them and I&#39;m right now I&#39;m reading a lot


about an African culture called the


aan um in West Africa in Ghana and they


their concepts of the soul the spirit


and the body and they have a word in


there called


sunum and we translated to Spirit but


then reading the African philosophers


who actually know that word and they go


it&#39;s not the it&#39;s not the same as the


word spirit and then they go on and


describe it and that one word contains


all of these other worlds that are so


weird and interesting that the word


spirit in English does not convey right


you know and other languages have that


sense and so language can have that


possibility where it opens up it&#39;s not


just this un this one track meaning it


has other valances other possibilities


to it right and so yeah we&#39;re kind of


deadening our language in a way and you


know if you study like other cultures


you know Eskimos had like a thousand


words for for snow and we have one word


you know Russians have like 40 words for


the color blue and we have one word kind


of thing are as the language gets


smaller and smaller and more uniform our


thoughts become more and more limited in


uniform so to know hear a word like


inner Sky it opens up all these other


ideas in your mind whereas we don&#39;t have


a word like that in English you know and


and then because I&#39;m I&#39;m doing things


with Zen Japanese language is so rich


with things that we can&#39;t possibly even


begin to express in English you know so


yeah what what have been other ways of


people opening up their minds this has


been something one of my favorite things


to do I remember reading a quote from


Robin Sharma years ago that said um


ordinary people have big TVs


extraordinary people have big libraries


uhuh and and it was one of those you


know little dreams I had that I was like


one day I have a home I&#39;m gon to have a


big library and and that was one of my


most favorite things to kind of put


together when when I moved here and um I


started spending more time in when I


would travel I&#39;ve always collected books


I&#39;ve always and and I started also


collecting expanding my audio library I


realized as I grew when I was growing up


we listen to a very limited form of


Music in my home and even as was growing


up as a teenager I listened to like one


genre of music what was that uh rap and


hip-hop like that was and again I love


rap and hip-hop I love rap and hip-hop


history it&#39;s super cool I have no issues


with it I just think that my audio


library was so limited in my teens that


now that I&#39;m in my 30s I&#39;m now listening


I&#39;m trying to listen to so many random


different things which again Inspire


different thoughts different feelings


different emotions and so I&#39;ve realized


that vocabulary was one thing audio has


been another thing what are other things


that you&#39;ve discovered that help open up


that Consciousness in mind because as we


both keep referring to social media


technology is is almost making us more


limited more singular more


onedimensional well um as I said it&#39;s


something I&#39;m I&#39;m writing about right


now so m music and the audible stuff is


very very interesting and very exciting


so this is new phenomenon where


musicologists have been able to recreate


music from eras that we never could


listen to before so I was writing at one


point about um a a uh Festival in


ancient Greece and to put me in the mood


I wanted to hear ancient Greek


music well that doesn&#39;t exist I mean no


recordings of me but sure enough there


are and The


rhythms and the sound is so weird and


alien that it makes it music captures


the spirit of a time right so if we&#39;re


only hearing these same Melodies you


hear cards going by with that same kind


of pop song it&#39;s such a limited circle


of Harmony such a limited circle of what


music can be but when you open up to


African music to music from anent


Babylonia to Greece to music in South


America other rhythms other poetry in in


music and sounds it&#39;s mind-blowing it&#39;s


interesting so that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying


that the human animal is much more


interesting than we think it is reading


about ancient cultures is a very mind


expansive um project you can go on any


books you&#39;d recommend in that


regard you know what&#39;s so exciting now


is they have these books called the


daily life in the daily life in ancient


Babylonia the daily life in um I forget


which city in India the daily life in


ancient Greece


Etc and you get a feel for not just the


grand philosophical issues but how


people ate what their houses were


like and so um so I was writing I just


wrote a chapter about our relationship


to time and history and I was trying to


take the reader in my new book I&#39;m


giving them exercises and I&#39;m saying try


to imagine yourself in a world a


thousand years ago and you walk out your


front door there&#39;s no mechanical sounds


there&#39;s no airplanes there&#39;s no cars


there&#39;s no machines it&#39;s just Birds


maybe a saw and a hammer is the most


you&#39;re going to hear that&#39;s a strange


thing there are no signs there no


advertisements there&#39;s no words


everywhere it&#39;s kind of empty


right you&#39;re just wandering around there


are all these kind of rancid weird


horrible smells cuz people aren&#39;t


bathing there&#39;s no but they&#39;re very


human smells right your whole sensory


experience is on another level but when


you live in this 21st century world


where things are so sanitized well we


don&#39;t smell these things we only hear


these packaged mechanical sounds your


sensory world is shrinking down and down


and down and you realize yeah ancient


world they had some bad stuff they


weren&#39;t very good you know they had


slavery I I I understand all the


negatives so I&#39;m not painting this


portrait but on another level their


realm of Senses the realm of language


their internal worlds were far richer


than ours and by connecting to that by


reading these books by reading books not


just the daily life thing I said but


actually text from those times as I was


mentioning when I read a monk a Zen monk


from the 11th century and the different


thought processes it opens my mind to a


different way of thinking to a different


way of accessing


reality but like I&#39;m reading a lot about


Aztecs because I&#39;m sort of obsessed with


the Aztec I don&#39;t know why and they had


these amazing spectacles that was the


thing about the ancient world these


festivals and spectacles that are far


beyond Burning Man or any Rock concert


right you know I could describe the fire


ceremony in azc culture that only


occurred every 70 years there is nothing


you can ever imagine in your life that


would be like that it is so utterly


spectacular and so I have this 800 page


book called Aztec philosophy it&#39;s very


theoretical but God it gives you an an


entree into a totally different way of


thinking about the world right where


they have these


metaphors um that the universe has this


energy some of the energy is like string


that&#39;s being wound around in a certain


way it&#39;s like weaving like other other


things like that this kind of energy


that the world has wow this is


fascinating you know our ancestors were


actually thinking but they&#39;re not our


they&#39;re us it&#39;s a human being we&#39;re all


human we all have those same kind of


Consciousness yeah you know I I love


also finding things in cultures that


match but are in different languages and


so what so I went to Hawaii a few years


ago which obviously for someone who grew


up in London it&#39;s not normal people in


America or La travel to Hawaii fairly


often I went to Hawaii and um well not


often it&#39;s more accessible but I went


recently and my wife and I went went on


one of the tours there and they showed


us uh the paragsachania


on the ground and they would then draw a


spiral around it and that would be seen


as a place that the child could always


come back to to feel the energy and


reconnect with the Earth how exciting


and I was thinking that&#39;s spectacular I


wish everyone felt disconnected to the


Earth and then we would go out every


morning on a canoe I forget their name


for it but they had their version for it


and they would pay respects to the sun


in the ocean and we would take part in


this ceremony with them and in India


there&#39;s something known as sua namashkar


which translates to Sun salutation sure


which again I&#39;ve talked to Andrew hubman


about this just like kicking off the


Circadian rhythm but the goal is you pay


your respects to the Sun for everything


it offers to you and the energy that it


provides and so to see that in Hawaiian


culture Indian culture and then I was in


Bhutan recently I went on a trip to


Bhutan which I&#39;d always wanted to visit


and this is a culture that really feels


like you&#39;re going back in time like you


walk out there and it feels like what


you just did described a thousand years


ago where is B landlocked between India


and China India and China so right in


between where they&#39;re having their


tensions the kind of Wars that&#39;s going


on a little bit or Bhutan doesn&#39;t have a


war no they don&#39;t even have a military


it&#39;s not part of their culture wow they


they believe in uh they&#39;re a Buddhist


nation is it a Buddhist Nation yes and


their practices are very protected the


culture is very protected like everyone


generally still wears the the the


cultural dress ex um it was it was


spectacular there&#39;s no there may be a


couple of these now but until very


recently there&#39;s no malls no Cinemas no


restaurants like


completely and it&#39;s beautiful because


it&#39;s just hills and mountains they


believe that the forests will always be


70% of the land mass because they


believe they&#39;re sacred you can&#39;t Trek up


to or ski on any of their mountains


because they&#39;re sacred they protect them


so there&#39;s a and you almost I almost


felt like what you just said there&#39;s no


signs you can&#39;t hear anything there&#39;s no


Machinery like it really does feel like


that yeah and we all all of us who were


there experienced this sense of


slowness that you don&#39;t experience


anywhere else not in a bad way in a in a


the mind the the gravity almost of the


space was really really powerful to


experience that&#39;s very exciting because


you know you can go out and into nature


into the mountains and you can feel that


and you can feel like this is what it


was like 2,000 100,000 years ago but we


don&#39;t have that feeling with human


things because every city has its


Starbucks its malls its generic culture


that we&#39;ve transported throughout the


world so to have a place where you can


actually go back in time is fantastic


but I wish it wasn&#39;t so far


away know yeah yeah it&#39;s F it&#39;s fine


it&#39;s fine it&#39;s worth visiting for anyone


who wants to it was a really special


trip but you&#39;re right the the generic


culture is the right word actually


there&#39;s there&#39;s a every street looks the


same every area looks the same you you


lo I know there&#39;s a lot of passion


behind local businesses and it&#39;s healthy


people want to support local business we


need more of that because the generic


culture really takes away from like you


expect I mean I was in India just


recently on the way back and it&#39;s like


there was a Tim Horton like right there


what a Tim Horton which I think is like


popular in Canada or somewhere like that


is it popular in the US Tim Horton no


it&#39;s Canada all my wife was telling me


about it but it was just one of the it&#39;s


it&#39;s and then there was a Starbucks and


then it was the same same thing and I


was like I&#39;m in India like you know like


I don&#39;t know expecting but it&#39;s yeah


it&#39;s the generic that&#39;s what&#39;s made the


brain so dull it has yeah yeah we&#39;re


becoming homogenized I mean I I like


going to countries like Mexico because


there&#39;s still pockets in Mexico


where you can feel of of a very


different culture you know it&#39;s only in


small little areas but it&#39;s very exci


it&#39;s nothing like Bhutan but you can


still get it a little bit you know yeah


Robert it&#39;s been such a joy talking to


you today and as always I love how we


just get lost and this is what I wanted


I was I was craving a authentic real


connection of where both of our minds


were in this moment okay yeah um but I


want to end with a few uh Sol uh


fastpaced questions we call this the


Fast Five uh and I probably did it with


you last time so I&#39;m going to change it


up this time for you I hope my mind is


fast enough to keep up with you so you


have to answer the questions it&#39;s more


like the final five you&#39;ve got to answer


the questions in one word to one


sentence


maximum so uh Robert Green these are


your final five the first question is


what is something you had wish you&#39;d


learned earlier the piano I mean I know


you were probably thinking about that&#39;s


beautiful something


about life but I love music and I wish I


had learned the piano when I was young


do you still play do you play now no no


okay uh second


question what is something that you used


to be sure about but that you now are


less sure about I guess a sense of


um right and wrong or good good and evil


mhm when I was young I had a very strong


sense of it that&#39;s a great answer and


now I&#39;m not so sure about what it is


it&#39;s a great answer uh question number


three if you could go back and live in


any age I&#39;m thinking you&#39;re going to say


the azex but uh where would you like to


go and where would you want to live and


what would you ask I would go


back to the Paleolithic Era and our


earliest


ancestors because I&#39;m fascinated by


their world and what they were like so


the Paleolithic


20,000 years ago okay and I would uh


like to know about their their religion


their spirituality I&#39;m interested in


origins of human consciousness so have


you read any books on that that yes what


would you recomend if someone&#39;s a


subject I was just my last chapter I was


writing about W the origin of language


is the origin of of human consciousness


wow it&#39;s the same time that there were


the cave


paintings right famous cave paintings in


France but they&#39;re all over the world


Aborigines Etc and that was the


beginning of symbolic


Consciousness yeah there are all sorts


of books written on that subject amazing


question number four if you could have


three people over at your dinner party


any three people you choose living or


dead who would they be what would be


friederick nche because I&#39;m reading a


biography of his right now that&#39;s


unbelievable um the other would be


Buddha


one odd and then the other would be U


it&#39;s very odd mix of people so I don&#39;t


know if they&#39;re going to get that&#39;s a


good pie that


is um yeah I I&#39;d say uh okay maybe


socres


okay and and Let The Fur


Fly uh Fifth and final question Robert I


find these stressful they are they are


stressful um something you&#39;re trying to


learn than right now to be more


forgiving about myself because I&#39;m


extremely unforgiving with yourself yeah


not easy it&#39;s not been my life pattern


where did the pursuit begin and why is


it a worthy Pursuit well I think because


um of my upbringing I always had a


feeling of never good


enough I&#39;m never smart enough I&#39;m not


doing enough I&#39;m not a good enough


person and I inter inter aliz that and


so um it&#39;s probably partially led to my


stroke probably me drive makes me drive


myself too hard and so sometimes I just


have to be more forgiving


so instead of thinking God I&#39;m never


going to write anymore that the well is


dry the the forgiving aspect is Robert


you&#39;re tired you&#39;re exhausted you&#39;re


doing fine it&#39;s going to come it will


come just trust it so it&#39;s kind of like


you know being indulgent towards


yourself I can be indulgent towards


other people but I can&#39;t be indulgent


towards myself so just learning to


forgive myself for not being perfect and


for not getting exactly what I want in


life it does the hardest thing for me


that&#39;s beautiful it&#39; be very good for my


health if I could if I could ever get


there that&#39;s beautiful thank you Robert


you&#39;re welcome everyone Robert Green I


hope you enjoyed this episode of me and


Robert truly just having a genuine


passionate conversation about things we


love please share on Tik Tok on X on


Instagram on Facebook whatever platform


you use in the YouTube comment section


what resonated with you what books


you&#39;re going to read what you connected


with maybe some of the creatives out


there who want to shift the way they


think or whether you got some great


insights on what are strong and weak


character points I want to know what hit


you what resonate with you and thank you


so much for listening and watching and


thank you again Robert for your time


than so much presence and energy so as


usual I really enjoyed it thank you that


means a lot yeah we go on for hours I


know truly if you love this episode


you&#39;ll love my interview with Dr gabo


mate on understanding your trauma and


how to heal emotional wounds to start


moving on from the past everything in


nature grows only where it&#39;s vulnerable


so a tree doesn&#39;t go where it&#39;s hard and


thick does it it goes where it&#39;s soft


and green and vulnerable
