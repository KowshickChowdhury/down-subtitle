this was one of the biggest days of my


podcasting career that&#39;s the magic of


naal ravikant Nal rant Nal ravikant


founder of Angel Del no rikan Naro rakan


the founder of angelist which is a giant


business I mean Global I I wonder if


you&#39;ve ever thought of that reality if


your parents didn&#39;t leave India and go


to the US how would your life be


different according to you the first


time I used an Apple computer it was an


old Macintosh I just fell in love with


it at some point if you have high agency


you will end up where you&#39;re meant to go


it&#39;s just going to take some effort did


it do anything for your mind I kind of


sometimes have these near-death


exercises where it&#39;s just like I imagine


myself dying it&#39;s like you can see


things fading out they call orgasm the


petite more The Little Death right did


you ever smoke weed you know I live in


California well the common belief now is


that like mushrooms are harmless right


they&#39;re


not do you miss your childhood I don&#39;t


have a it&#39;s like a dream is it real


actually


happened B has had a great saying in


every human there is a sense that


something infinite has been lost wow has


marriage brought further understanding


when it comes to life there&#39;s a secret


to a happy relationship is to happy


people you know what I&#39;ve learned about


marriage one&#39;s wife is always right and


that&#39;s the rule one should follow yes I


reject that completely uh yeah people


say like happy wife happy life that&#39;s


all propaganda that&#39;s all feminine


propaganda you&#39;re being brainwashed no


both people have to be equally happy


really you know from the outside looking


in I personally have this impression of


Naval rikan the brand and the human and


I feel like nothing hurts that guy I&#39;m a


very paranoid person so my rule is I


don&#39;t fight with people if somebody


wants to fight with me we get one fight


and then it&#39;s over there&#39;s a lot of


people out there and life is long do you


pray if you are older in life and you


don&#39;t have the Next Generation to look


forward to then you better find God fast


because I don&#39;t think like your own mind


and your own life will be kind to you as


you get older


if you know who Naval ravikant is please


head straight into the conversation this


intro is primarily crafted for those of


you who are being introduced to Naval


ravikant for the first time surprisingly


there&#39;s a lot of people in India who are


yet to be introduced to who I consider


to be the greatest philosopher of our


times I genuinely believe that history


will remember him as one of the greatest


Minds that lived in the 21st century


he&#39;s an extremely humble extremely


relaxed individual so I know that this


intro is going to bother him on some


level that&#39;s the side of Naval that I


got to know through this conversation


this is the most casual conversation


that the internet has ever seen with


this man it was one of the biggest


honors of my own podcasting career to be


sharing screen space and podcasting


space with Naval ravikant if I had to


introduce him professionally of course


I&#39;d tell you how he&#39;s one of the most


iconic Angel Investors in the world of


course i&#39; tell you about how he&#39;s one of


the most important thought leaders for


Silicon Valley and the world of Global


Twitter or X it&#39;s Naval ravikant on the


RV show this is one of the most


memorable episodes for me on a personal


level but if you&#39;re looking for depth in


conversation it doesn&#39;t get deeper than


Naval rikan&#39;s mind it&#39;s Naval on


TRS huge day for my career honestly huge


day for my own Human Experience


enjoy the


[Music]


episode this is one of the biggest days


of my podcasting career but I&#39;m also


feeling supremely comfortable that&#39;s the


magic of Nel ravian oh you&#39;re very nice


welcome to the ren show sir thank you


thanks for having me uh visualize this


moment so much over the years so as I


told you in the car ride on the way here


uh I&#39;m full of gratitude and as we go


forward in this conversation I&#39;m going


to pour more and more gratitude on you


uh when we were on our way here from the


network state conference I saw how much


you were hounded uh people just want to


come up and say that they love you uh


this takes me back to that Joe Rogan


episode you did in 2019 are you aware of


how many young men&#39;s lives that episode


affected I have no idea why to be honest


I feel like I just said the same things


I was saying they&#39;re kind of obvious and


maybe uh don&#39;t be so easily influenced


really yeah think for yourself you know


decide for yourself you know how I look


at it so in 2019 I was 26 running four


businesses parall getting extremely


stressed out but those two hours of that


episode created switches in me and my


journey from age 26 to age 31 has been


much more lubricated especially from a


mental health perspective so you&#39;ve done


a lot for the mental health of many men


all over the world how how much do we


really figure out ourselves right


there&#39;s like there there&#39;s what are the


different kinds of knowledge this weth


thinking through right I&#39;m just thinking


it through with you so there&#39;s Knowledge


from direct experience right you


experience something and that generates


knowledge inside of you there&#39;s


knowledge that you pick up from other


sources you just a vessel that&#39;s passing


through you you picked it up you


synthesize it you


regurgitate there&#39;s uh knowledge that


you create which is rare um um I don&#39;t


know if I said anything original really


yeah I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know but I


think you accumulated a lot of data


which is back by years of reading and


research I think if I were to look back


I would say that the only true knowledge


I have is the knowledge that is uh


directly verified by me and uh fits in


with the other pieces so I view myself


as a very basic thinker really yeah I


don&#39;t view myself as an advanced thinker


I&#39;m not an expert in anything but what I


like to do is everything that comes my


way I like to deeply understand it as


simply as possible I have to be able to


put it in simple words and simple


Frameworks and simple Concepts and I


have to be able to do it uh almost


visually in my mind and exponentially


have to map it to some experience that I


have and then I have to be able to take


that and I have to be able to plug it


into something else I understand it has


to fit in a steel frame of understanding


at the basics of knowledge uh so for


example mathematics I was never very


good at mathematics I wanted to be a


physicist but I I wasn&#39;t good at


calculus but my basic math is really


really good um the same way I don&#39;t have


the largest vocabulary but I have a very


solid vocabulary and I can be very


precise with my words even when I speak


I&#39;m not the fastest speaker I&#39;m not the


slowest speaker so I think for me it&#39;s


just about I don&#39;t take there&#39;s a great


uh motto from the Royal Society which


was the Society of scientists in uh


Britain during their Enlightenment era


and uh the motto of the royal so Society


is nullus and verba I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m


mangling the Latin but it means take no


one&#39;s word for it and I love that uh


take no one&#39;s word for it so I think uh


we are encouraged these days to take in


knowledge pour it into our heads like a


bucket and uh we regurgitate it and we


use fancy words to cover up what we


don&#39;t mean what we don&#39;t know and I


don&#39;t accept that unless I understand


something at its core fundamental level


I don&#39;t understand it and then beyond


that level I get bored I don&#39;t care to


understand it so I think just being able


to be very particular about what you


take in make sure you truly understand


it and that it is true truth is the most


important thing because if you&#39;re going


ahead with falsehoods because they&#39;re


convenient you&#39;re just going to walk


around bumping your head against reality


and wondering why it hurts so it&#39;s


important to just always look for the


truth figure it out for yourself make


sure it fits into your understanding be


open to revising it because you&#39;re


always wrong it&#39;s just question of how


wrong you are uh and then using that to


uh find the commonalities in life and


and navigate it and I think that&#39;s why


uh you&#39;re better off asking someone like


me about very basic things uh than about


very Advanced things can I ask you a


basic question sure yeah please what&#39;s


the meaning of


life we talk about this for hours I


think about it all the time I think


about it I I want to kind of reframe it


a little bit sure yeah uh what&#39;s new


right now in life for you it&#39;s been 5


years since that Joe Rogan episode and


we got to know you so deeply then yeah


but what&#39;s happened in the last five


years I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t uh


retrospect on myself I don&#39;t think about


myself that&#39;s what&#39;s new no no I just


don&#39;t I I couldn&#39;t tell you because I


don&#39;t think about myself I don&#39;t think


about what&#39;s changed in my life and if


my life is good or bad or if this


happened or that happened and I don&#39;t


look at all photos of me and I don&#39;t


think about old trips and I think about


people that are gone you know I don&#39;t I


don&#39;t think about the past I just don&#39;t


live in the past at all do you pray uh


not in the traditional sense no uh I


think prayer implies some kind of an


external entity that I&#39;m asking


something for and sure like every person


I might have done that here or there um


usually we&#39;re fair weather friends with


any God that&#39;s out there right when we


need help we&#39;re like all prayer and when


we don&#39;t we&#39;re like everything&#39;s good


it&#39;s all me right so no I don&#39;t I don&#39;t


pray in the traditional sense


uh but I am very deeply I hate the word


but it&#39;s spiritual right and I would


Define spiritual in a negative way it


just means not mental not physical right


so but why do you hate the


words because it&#39;s overloaded with a lot


of religiosity um all of a sudden you&#39;re


supposed to be a spiritual being you&#39;re


supposed to do yoga you&#39;re supposed to


meditate and you&#39;re supposed to sit


cross- lugged and you&#39;re supposed to you


know then you argue about is the bagat


Gita or the asash Gita or the you know


all of these roads lead to the same


place um the the the best way I would SU


Ariz my thinking on this is that I think


existence itself is a miracle the oldest


questions are why is there something


instead of nothing why are we here


what&#39;s the meaning of life these are all


just variants in the same question and


there is no answer to that does that


mean there can never be an answer to


that no not necessarily but if you start


going down that road you&#39;ll find all


kinds of contradictions for example with


just the meaning of life right if there


was a single meaning of life then we


would all be slaves to it suppose the


meaning of life was to help others and


we would all be running around trying to


help others and you know there&#39;d be no


room for the individual if the meaning


of life was to you know be strong and


fit and healthy then we&#39;d all be working


out um we&#39;d all be I don&#39;t know how beer


and biceps go together but you know we&#39;d


all be building our biceps so it&#39;s


better that there is no overarching


singular meaning of life it&#39;s better


that there are personal interpretations


got um however within those personal


interpretations you know we we all have


even though we have complete freedom to


choose any meaning that we want and we


can create our own meaning at any moment


um


there are certain common things in what


we all want as well and so that&#39;s kind


of the Paradox of being a human


individual where you&#39;re completely an


individual but you&#39;re also completely


Interlink to everything and anything


that exists you couldn&#39;t change you


couldn&#39;t change a particle in the


universe without changing this moment


right not in any meaningful way um


although that&#39;s not entirely true there


are error correcting mechanisms built


into into the structure of the universe


so uh but a lot of things had to cons in


a very particular way to bring us here


together today right um so in that sense


everything is very interconnected on the


other


hand my life is and your lives are


single player games inside our heads you


know we interpret everything from birth


to death uh your experience of uh your


experiences are singular to you uh no


one will truly ever understand you or


get you uh and you&#39;re always searching


for that Unity that connection that that


going back to uh you know Oneness Source


togetherness whatever you want to call


it Community there&#39;s many words for


it in terms of uh you know back to


meaning of life the way I think of it is


that existence itself is a miracle and


everything else is science and I think


that&#39;s the best of all possible worlds


so spirituality is a side that lies on


what who am I why am I here how long


have I got what am I here for and these


are questions that are really only


answerable at a personal level this


miraculous little world that we&#39;re in is


beautifully put together I couldn&#39;t I


couldn&#39;t do a better job for sure for


sure I couldn&#39;t even begin to do the job


and just to give you some ideas as to


you know just some observations how well


it&#39;s put together the fact that science


works that&#39;s magic technology works that


is Magic you go back and you read books


on magic or magicians or fantasy books


they don&#39;t have a hundred of the power


that we have they don&#39;t have


self-driving cars they don&#39;t have


smartphones they don&#39;t have antibiotics


they don&#39;t have Rockets um they don&#39;t


even have fantasy novels they don&#39;t even


have clean running water they don&#39;t have


reliable food they don&#39;t have food


delivery services right uh so we are


already living in an age of Miracles


that the best part is we can control and


the magic spells that we cast are under


the opice of science the Wizardry that


we create is through technology and


that&#39;s all manipulable through laws and


and rules and systems that we discover


and we discover and we create and that


is incredible we&#39;re all magicians I


wouldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t ask for a better


system if an actual Miracle showed up


afterwards supposed somebody showed up


and turned uh loaves into fish or water


into wine that would destroy our world


because all of a sudden you be like oh


my God there&#39;s all these rules for this


new thing that we don&#39;t understand how


it works so now science is junk and you


wouldn&#39;t know how to navigate the world


and now You&#39; be the mercy of demons and


angels and spirits and you&#39;d be running


around worshiping and praying then you


would pray because you&#39;d be like how do


I make sense of this world so I think we


live in the best of all possible worlds


okay uh I think the geography that one


grows up in definitely determines their


mindset in life to a large degree


and uh personally my take on


spirituality is affected by growing up


in India you read books like the


autobiography of your Yogi you read the


life of the Buddha uh I definitely feel


that there&#39;s a higher stage of


Consciousness and I don&#39;t feel like


we&#39;ve reach the final state of evolution


uh there is definitely an end point


which is also beyond the next stage of


evolution uh and I do believe that you


know you say that Cal a calm mind is


earned MH I think that&#39;s one of the


steps on the ladder and then there&#39;s


like higher stage


mhm I I don&#39;t know how useful it is to


prognosticate about where humanity is


headed unless you get there yourself


first uh and and you don&#39;t have the


ability to do anything for anyone unless


you embody it yourself uh so so to the


extent that you think humanity is headed


there I say get there first and then


show them the way I definitely think


that Nal rant is already on that ladder


as compared to other human beings I have


no idea where I&#39;m on that ladder you


don&#39;t think you&#39;re slightly more


evolved no I I


don&#39;t that&#39;s a loaded question


uh first of all I don&#39;t think of myself


I I just want to be clear on that and


that&#39;s not a rule it&#39;s just a habit I&#39;ve


kind of developed because I found that


thinking about yourself is a source of


all unhappiness and misery really yes


self-obsession is the root of all


unhappiness what did Buddha do conquer


the self what does that mean means that


he saw through the illusion of the


separate self what does that did Buddha


think about himself not for an instant


you know anyone that you think of as an


enlightened being does not think about


themselves for an instant the happiest


people in life when people are their


best is because uh they love something


more than they love themselves they love


their children they love God they love


their mission what have you and all


misery comes from rumination from


sitting around being depressed going in


circles in your own head about me me me


me is a disease and uh you need the a


concept of a me to be effective and to


keep track of things you have a memory


you have certain predictions your


personality patterns but the more you


self- obsessed the less happy you&#39;re


going to be I guarantee you that and I&#39;m


not doing I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t think


about myself to be happy I can&#39;t even


tell you why I don&#39;t think about myself


I think it just comes from having


thought through a lot of things and then


just I I get interested in topics and


Concepts and ideas and understandings


and the more that I sort of focus that


way the less I just end up thinking


about myself so even like you know


people ask me like oh how&#39;s your day


going I&#39;m like I have no idea I don&#39;t


think about it really yeah good maybe if


I&#39;m really tired I&#39;ll say okay I&#39;m tired


you know if something really bad


happened like oh it wasn&#39;t a great day


but most of the time I couldn&#39;t even


tell you my own State of Mind okay cuz


I&#39;m not interested in it I don&#39;t think


it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s interesting for us


and I&#39;ll give you some perspective here


yeah we were one of the first podcasts


in India uh currently the biggest and I


feel that&#39;s an outcome of constantly


tearing apart people&#39;s chest getting


into their hearts and getting to know


them because in India we&#39;re emotional


people and we want to know the emotions


of others we want to know what&#39;s in


other people&#39;s mind or it&#39;s dumb luck


cuz you started early I&#39;m just kidding


or or that of course not I&#39;m just joking


with you luck is definitely a part of me


I mean look luck favors are prepared uh


Joe Rogan uh is incredibly successful


because he was doing podcasting before


his podcasting he was the top guy on


Ustream which was just like a streaming


thing on the internet before podcasting


came along so uh there&#39;s a certain kind


of person that it takes to be


early you make your own luck in that


sense I actually


luck is luck is one of those things that


you shouldn&#39;t believe in even if it&#39;s


true because believing it will hurt your


agency just like victim mentality right


thinking you&#39;re a victim even if it&#39;s


true don&#39;t believe it because it&#39;ll just


hurt your agency because you have no


power as a victim you have no power if


things are up to luck uh whatever power


you have in life comes from believing


that you can change things and do things


and even if you can&#39;t change the outside


you can at least change the inside No


One controls your mind but you um so


yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s not luck I was jok


talking the question I have for you is


while all of us sit in India and view


Naval ravikant ruling the internet in so


many ways uh a lot of Indians feel very


proud okay to see someone from India uh


you know who shares genetics with us uh


kind of kill it on a world stage uh so


I&#39;ve had this thought experiment lately


as I&#39;ve been researching for this


episode I thought to myself that what if


Noel&#39;s parents didn&#39;t leave India and


what if he was in Delhi I&#39;m pretty sure


you&#39;d still uh take up some form of


Entrepreneurship knowing your


personality because I think there&#39;s some


traits that don&#39;t change uh but then


there&#39;s a lot that changes because of


geography I I wonder if you&#39;ve ever


thought of that reality if your parents


didn&#39;t leave India uh and go to the US


how would your life be different


according to you I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to


downplay geography at all I actually


think where you live is the single most


important decision you make uh but the


first part of that is making a decision


uh I like to think that even if my


parents had not immigrated to the US I


would have probably done so at a later


age because I was ambitious uh and I


wanted to be around smart people and I


wanted to build things uh when I


immigrated to the US I was not in any


position to go to Silicon Valley and


build things I had to kind of you know


claw my way there um and I got there a


little later than I should have frankly


but at any given time in the world&#39;s


history there&#39;s usually only one or two


places that really matter in terms of


moving the world forward so there was a


time when it was Athens in ancient


Greece there&#39;s a time when it was


Florence in Italy there&#39;s a time when it


was uh London in the United Kingdom and


the the time when I was kind of coming


into my formative years it was Silicon


Valley and I knew that I the first time


I used an Apple computer it was an old


Macintosh in uh the computer room in my


high school I just fell in love with it


and I and I just knew that I had to get


closer to uh Apple that that was the


thing that pulled me in when I got to


Silicon Valley the first thing I did was


with my bags I went in a taxi straight


from the airport to app&#39;s headquarters


and I wandered around um and I&#39;d read


this book by Guy Kawasaki called the


Macintosh way that was very


inspirational to me so at some point if


you are if you have high agency if


you&#39;re a person that&#39;s selfmotivated


which I think almost everybody watching


this is um you will end up where you&#39;re


meant to go it&#39;s just going to take some


effort the universe drops plenty of


opportunity around you but it&#39;s not


necessarily on your head and you have to


walk over there and pick it up your


podcast didn&#39;t build itself for example


counterfactuals are impossible to do


like uh yes if you had gone if you had


immigrated to the US early you&#39;d


probably be doing a podcast in the US um


or uh you know if you weren&#39;t born a


podcaster you found your way to being a


podcaster so even though yes there&#39;s


luck involved there&#39;s counterfactuals


involved there&#39;s immigration involved


don&#39;t believe that stuff you know it&#39;s


better to uh just kind of take


responsibility both externally and


internally externally for what you manag


to do and internally for how you feel


about it uh like one of my little tweets


to myself and all the good ones are to


myself was I and I alone am responsible


for everything I think and feel um so


for example if I get mad at somebody


about something it&#39;s my fault why am I


mad why am I making myself angry um why


can&#39;t I just deal with the same


situation in a cool calm and collected


way why do I have to show to or not even


show why do I have to lose control


because anger is a loss of self-control


why why am I still so broken inside that


that happens so I I kind of reject this


line of questioning to be honest you


know what if what if what if who cares


what if we&#39;re here um you know you


constantly talk about that steel


framework thing you say that learn the


first principles yes um while we were at


the event a lot of the people backstage


were like ask navel about how he


achieved this level of clarity and I


understand that you focus on first


principles thinking but what&#39;s


underneath that thought like did you


read a book at some point in life that


pointed you towards it no no no no no I


I think uh when I was young my dad


wasn&#39;t around much and uh he was gone he


had to he immigrated to the US before


the rest of us did it took four years


where he could pull us there and then my


parents went through divorce and so on


so one good thing was I never had


anybody telling me what to do ever um


and I had to figure everything out for


myself and I think that helps a lot it


makes you very high agency um I also


nobody in my like my aunts and my mom


they loved us to death but there was


nobody saying this is right that&#39;s wrong


do it this way don&#39;t do it that way so


you figure it out for yourself and


started with reading but eventually just


goes to thinking but I don&#39;t think


there&#39;s anything special I I think I


think deep down everybody wants to


understand things right everybody wants


to learn everyone&#39;s curious all children


are curious any young child they&#39;ll be


asking questions all day long and I


think the trick is just don&#39;t stop


asking questions and keep asking


questions until you can answer something


your own


satisfaction um maybe I had the luxury


of the time to read you know that&#39;s


helpful because it helps answer


questions when you&#39;re younger at least


some some reading a lot of too much


reading or reading the wrong things can


be bad too right because you can stuff


your head with the wrong things I I I


guess for for decades I did not feel


like I was that smart because what would


happen is I would talk to somebody and


they&#39;d say well there&#39;s this and that


and there&#39;s this and they would just


start using big terms and big words and


defining huge things and and it took me


a long time to figure out they didn&#39;t


know what they were talking about if


someone&#39;s using a lot of big words you


know it&#39;s the mark of a charlatan to


explain simple things in a complex way


and uh it&#39;s a mark of a Genius Like


Richard Fineman to to explain


complicated things in simple ways the


smartest people actually understand what


they&#39;re talking about so they can


explain it in plain English they don&#39;t


need to resort to abstractions they


don&#39;t need to impress and a lot of times


with abstractions are leaky you poke at


them and it doesn&#39;t quite map or it


doesn&#39;t mean what what they think it


means um I&#39;d rather like stick and I&#39;m a


failed physicist I wanted to be a


physicist so and my ma math wasn&#39;t good


enough plus I wanted to make money so it


didn&#39;t work out but uh I was surrounded


by a lot of physicists and I read a lot


of physics and so I felt dumb compared


to the other physicists and so I I well


I you&#39;re not going to trick a physicist


you&#39;re not going to walk in and start


talking physics and then suddenly like


you you say something that&#39;s wrong


they&#39;re going to call you on it physics


is very rigorous and same thing with


computer science which I did end up


studying is the code has to compile the


code has to run the code has to work you


can&#39;t you can&#39;t trick the machine using


words and so I think having a grounding


in scientific disciplines around


scientific people forces you to be


rigorous and humble about your actual


sphere of knowledge uh you can&#39;t Bluff


people um systems in which you get


feedback like real feedback uh free


markets and nature right you can&#39;t trick


nature I can&#39;t lie to Nature uh and I


can&#39;t trick free markets all end up


broke so these systems give you very


good feedback and they force you into


being rigorous um but it&#39;s very easy to


trick people so if you&#39;re in politics if


you&#39;re in law if you&#39;re in journalism if


you&#39;re in media uh if you&#39;re just you


know bsing with your friends it&#39;s very


easy to trick people and then you get


social rewards you don&#39;t get the


negative feedback and that gets baked


into your personality your identity your


way of thinking uh so I think I was


fortunate enough to be


scientifically uh to get scientific


feedback and to be pushed back upon


through science and scientific people um


also grew up in a tough environment so


it was a no BS environment you had to be


correct so you know when you&#39;re trying


to survive you have to be correct uh


when you have an abundance of resources


and things are easy you don&#39;t have to be


right because you there&#39;s cushions


everywhere in the environment for you um


so maybe I was forged that way but like


I said I don&#39;t I don&#39;t introspect much I


don&#39;t it doesn&#39;t really matter to me


it&#39;s ancient history all that matters is


here because this is all there is so


let&#39;s talk about the Hein now yeah uh


you&#39;re 50 now yeah has your definition


of Love changed at all love is just it&#39;s


one of these overloaded words it&#39;s like


Freedom you know it means anything you


want but what does love mean okay I I


think so what is love


okay this romantic love which we&#39;re all


familiar with Bollywood thrives on that


right that&#39;s that&#39;s an attachment thing


it&#39;s like I love you if you love me


let&#39;s go have kids together yes this a


biological programming it&#39;s there it&#39;s


important it&#39;s good to have that&#39;s not


the real love or you love like a fanboy


like how all of us love you yeah love


love is a feeling of unity it&#39;s the it&#39;s


the attraction to yourself actually it


is seeing yourself in something else and


then kind of wanting to complete with it


um so you can have a spiritual love


which is a love for Oneness or God you


can have a love for your children


because they&#39;re just part of you you can


have a love for your community because


it&#39;s it&#39;s like you you can have love for


your ideas so love is attraction in that


sense it&#39;s like a it&#39;s a positive


attraction where you you see the unity


in the thing with you and you don&#39;t


necess want anything out of it and you


know that&#39;s a that&#39;s a genuine love um


the nice thing about love is if you


think back in your life to when you were


loved a lot right like you were loved by


your parents great wonderful to be loved


by your parents some point you took it


for granted let&#39;s be honest we all take


our parents for granted that&#39;s one of


the things you learn as a parent


yourself you&#39;re like oh my God my


parents put up with all of this they


were Saints right um You you really only


start valuing your parents when you have


your own children then you realize what


a one-way relation relationship that


love relationship and it&#39;s fine that&#39;s


the way it&#39;s meant to be even your


parents they want what&#39;s best for you


they want you to love your kids not to


love them back at the same level so uh


one of the things you learn about love


is okay when you&#39;re receiving love you


take it for granted and it can even be a


little too much like for example


someone&#39;s attracted to you and you&#39;re


not attracted to them you&#39;re like right


the overzealous fan you know the girl


the guy who&#39;s like chasing you around


you&#39;re like I don&#39;t really know I don&#39;t


I&#39;m not really into this so that kind of


love is the love that we think we want


but we don&#39;t really I mean yes we want a


little bit of it so we don&#39;t feel


completely alone and and it makes us


feel safe but it&#39;s not really the love


that you want now think back to when you


were in love when you&#39;re in love with an


idea how you just work on it


passionately when you&#39;re in love with


let&#39;s say God or spirituality how you&#39;re


just taken and you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re


swept away or when you&#39;re even in love


with a person you&#39;re in love with a


woman or your love with a man and all of


a sudden everything is brighter and


everyone&#39;s happier and you&#39;re just like


walking on Cloud9 the feeling of being


in love is greater than the feeling of


being loved is my point okay and you can


be in love anytime you want and how do


you be in love well you can&#39;t be forced


right you can&#39;t buy love you can&#39;t force


love but I will say a commonality is


generally the less you are thinking


about yourself going back to what I was


saying earlier the more you&#39;re going to


be able to love other people and other


things so for example the Buddhas uh you


know I you know people will sometimes


say well that&#39;s not a Buddha cuz that


person is not loving enough well that&#39;s


that&#39;s not necessarily true love is not


a requirement for being a Buddha but it


is an output of being a Buddha because a


Buddha is a person who has seen through


the illusion of the separate self uh and


once they&#39;ve seen through the illusion


of the separate self they&#39;re no longer


self- obsessed and therefore their love


that was earlier turned inwards and


became ego love for the self went


outwards and it still flows uh as a very


simple example you know here&#39;s something


I uh uh is a little embarrassing but


I&#39;ll be vulnerable you like vulnerable


vulnerability right so I I I I kind of


sometimes have these near-death


exercises right where it&#39;s just like I


imagine myself dying and it&#39;s not


something that I do deliberately just


kind of happens the the moments when you


go into bed but before you fall asleep


are really interesting because your mind


goes into a really hazy almost


psychedelic State and and I used to


meditate a lot and somewhere along the


way I just found that state between


sleeping and waking to be really


entertaining and entertaining


entertaining yeah it&#39;s just entertaining


so next time you&#39;re falling asleep just


make a just just the smallest effort


because if you make any real effort


you&#39;ll fall you won&#39;t be able to sleep


but make the smallest effort just to be


aware of your thoughts as you&#39;re falling


asleep as you&#39;re going to sleep and your


thoughts start going wackier and wackier


and wackier and they will just get wild


like I&#39;ll have cats talking to me and


you know just like weird stuff going in


and out just it&#39;s like dreams you&#39;re


you&#39;re basically lucid dreaming as


you&#39;re falling asleep and they&#39;re the


craziest dream they don&#39;t make any sense


it&#39;s all nonsense You observe your own


thoughts as you&#39;re about to fall asleep


as I&#39;m about to fall asleep that&#39;s when


that&#39;s when your thoughts start going


off the rails you stop thinking about


like what am I doing tomorrow and how to


work go today and you just start having


these wacky random Connections in your


head and it can be really fun to watch I


was doing it just as an entertainment


thing the an exploratory thing what have


you found out I&#39;m not looking to find


anything so I think that&#39;s part of


curiosity you have to be a little


careful because if you go looking for


something in particular then you&#39;re only


open to seeing that thing and that&#39;s not


how you find anything that&#39;s true um but


it it&#39;s just pure mere curiosity it&#39;s


it&#39;s an entertaining State that&#39;s that&#39;s


a fine reason to do it right we do


everything because we enjoy it at the


end of the day if you didn&#39;t you


wouldn&#39;t do it right or you want to not


NE enjoy it but you do it because you


want to um so I did it just because I


wanted to and once in a while once in a


while and I&#39;m not trying to suggest


anything because again if I suggest


something then it&#39;s not going to happen


for you but you know I&#39;ll basically feel


like I&#39;m dying so I&#39;m falling asleep but


I feel like I&#39;m dying it&#39;s like you can


see things fading out right and as you


fall asleep the the French uh no that&#39;s


not they call orgasm the petite more The


Little Death right but uh but it&#39;s also


because your mind shuts down right so


what&#39;s happening is your your mind is


shutting down from waking to sleeping


State and that&#39;s kind of a death


transition you can kind of feel like


you&#39;re dying and you can literally see


thoughts going offline your mind goes


offline and as your mind goes offline


pay atten attention to what


remains pay attention to what actually


remains and don&#39;t be afraid of it don&#39;t


be AF you&#39;re just falling asleep but


like I said sometimes it feels like


you&#39;re dying and don&#39;t be afraid of


death right you just kind of go with it


it&#39;s what&#39;s just what&#39;s happening and


then as your mind disappears as things


disappear as things Fade Out of


existence see what remains okay there&#39;s


a version of something like this that I


do for me the last two thoughts are


always


the girl I&#39;m seeing and or uh the God I


know MH which is just Universal energy


yeah these are all manifestations of


what you would call love right this is


this is you stop thinking about yourself


because thoughts are what Drive the


self- obsession the self is ultimately


just a thought it&#39;s a it&#39;s a the self is


a thought that I am a separate creature


I&#39;m a body I&#39;m a mind and if you truly


were not thinking like you&#39;re in deep


meditation or you&#39;re on a psychedelic or


you&#39;re a Buddha you wouldn&#39;t have a


thought of the self and you would just


be you just be be aware that&#39;s all


that&#39;s all there is I think the


difference in your state of


consciousness and mine is one you&#39;re


much older and you&#39;ve seen life and by


older I mean brain older not physical


body older you&#39;re a wiser human being


and I think over the years you&#39;ve just


learned to observe and pick up data from


everywhere U my early life experiences


kind of catered me towards a deep sense


of what we call bti in India which is uh


nisat prame or unselfish love towards


the Divine it&#39;s just an outcome of


living in India in my eyes yeah no I I


what matters is truth not who says what


or what where you lived or what book you


read what just matters is what&#39;s true


and that you can figure out for yourself


and you can figure it out just as well


as me and you probably have your your


core experience of of your awareness


same as mine every emotion you felt I


felt every emotion I felt you felt we&#39;re


human no Human Experience is alien to us


so we can have all the same feelings and


thoughts just in different levels and


different bases um i s i s I sort of


reject this idea that I&#39;m Wiser or more


advanced I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true no if


I was wise I&#39;d be a Buddha I&#39;m not so


it&#39;s like you know two ants debating


like you know who&#39;s smarter and there&#39;s


like a there&#39;s like a human walking


around over there right what ises it


matter okay not in our eyes because for


a lot of dudes in their 20s and 30s you


are what we want to become especially


from a peace perspective I&#39;m the same


guy I&#39;ve always been and I wouldn&#39;t even


say I&#39;m that peaceful my mind is a wreck


really yeah I&#39;m always like my mind&#39;s


always running all over the place it&#39;s


it&#39;s it&#39;s always active you know how you


said that happiness is peace and motion


mhm uh that&#39;s something that stayed with


me over the years and it&#39;s something I


practiced the the person who&#39;s going to


know the most about weight loss is the


person who was fat as a kid the person


who&#39;s going to know the most about peace


and happiness is the one who was the


most miserable inside so don&#39;t take from


anything I write to say that I&#39;m some


peaceful Zen Buddha inside I&#39;m not my


mind still runs out of control it&#39;s I&#39;m


a crazy person I&#39;m a I&#39;m a crazy person


who&#39;s trying to be a little less crazy


and observing my own craziness that


that&#39;s how I can come back to you and


say like you know when I started


tweeting a lot uh about anything other


than technology so I I you know I was an


investor in Twitter early on small


investor in 2007 and Twitter really


launched and started getting big around


2010 not even big it was still small but


I was active on Twitter from the start


but around 2012 2013 I was going through


a tough period and that&#39;s when I started


tweeting uh the stuff that I was


supposed to tweet and I you know I


started getting feedback from people in


the environment who were like hey that&#39;s


weird you know you&#39;re like a VC you&#39;re


like an entrepreneur people not going to


trust you they think you&#39;re strange are


you high you know that was like a


constant uh thing and I was just like I


I don&#39;t care I&#39;m just writing to myself


right and and I was writing down my


crazier and crazier thoughts uh and I


for a long time I got no positive


feedback on it which is fine it&#39;s


actually fine because if you if you&#39;re


doing it for positive feedback you&#39;re


eventually going to end up doing the


right the wrong thing right I like


burning my audience I like occasionally


I&#39;ll tweet things that I don&#39;t


completely believe that are a little


incendiary because I want to find all


the people who get easily triggered so I


can block them uh I just want to blow


them out I don&#39;t care about followers


followers are worthless right if easy


mechanism to adjust your friend list


yeah if you&#39;re if you&#39;re if you&#39;re doing


anything for followers your followers


are worthless uh you know who would you


have rather follow you 10 people that


you respect that are intelligent and


interesting and wise or like a million


monkeys so the the follower count thing


is utterly worthless and I don&#39;t even


want followers I only want peer


relationships um because follower is


kind of a weird thing now this this


person&#39;s not thinking for themselves and


uh no what what every intelligent person


craves is other intelligent people right


to help things things through uh and to


kind of bond with but um I don&#39;t know


where I was going with this but yeah


screw followers anyway yeah I was I was


tweeting and I was tweeting like the


craziness in my mind right I was I&#39;m a


crazy person


and so I was just going through my own


head and trying to sort out my own


thoughts and it&#39;s a complete mess and uh


it turns out that we all have the same


internal thoughts and we all have the


same internal experiences we all do we


have them in different order maybe we


interpret different things from them but


we all have the same feelings so every


time I put out some late night tweet


with some crazy thought you know people


around the world would just be like yeah


I&#39;m thinking that too um I forget who


said this there was a great line that I


read a long time ago but it was


something like oh I think it was Emerson


uh and he said uh you know in every


genius we see our own ordinary thoughts


but they come back to us with a certain


alienated


Majesty right so it&#39;s it&#39;s just the


willingness to say it combined with


saying it in an interesting way so what


I realized was that what I liked about


Twitter it was like an open Journal


which forced me to craft my thoughts it


would give me feedback obviously because


people will come out and correct you


even if you&#39;re correct


and what I enjoyed writing was I liked


saying things that I thought were true


that were novel to me in that moment


obviously anything I can think of


somebody else has probably thought of


with very few exceptions


so it was something novel to me


something that was true and I would say


it in an interesting way so that I would


remember it uh and because I read a lot


as a kid I tried writing I wasn&#39;t I


didn&#39;t have the patience to be a long


form writer I wrote a few blog posts and


never even wrote a book and uh I tried


poetry um because I like reading poetry


but I didn&#39;t care to learn meter and


Rhythm and rhyme I just cared about the


words and the and how evocative they


were and so Twitter was a perfect medium


for me it allowed me to be to use word


selection and simple Framing and


explanation to really hone down things


that I thought to be true and were


interesting to me and write them as


notes to myself and to this day like


every day I go on Twitter and someone&#39;s


quote tweeted me on something or there&#39;s


like some Nal bot that&#39;s like thrown up


a noal quote and I look at them I&#39;m like


oh I should follow that advice damn that


was good like that was written to me


that&#39;s a note to sell from me from five


years ago I should take my own advice


it&#39;s kind of like you&#39;re growing up in


front of the world yeah it&#39;s and we&#39;re


all always growing up right we&#39;re all


we&#39;re all always on this journey of


self-discovery this single player game


or we&#39;re alone inside but yet we&#39;re


deeply interconnected because we&#39;re all


having the same thoughts the same


emotions the same experiences with maybe


different interpretations often the same


interpretations the great questions in


life the meaning of life or you know


what am I doing here or what should I do


uh they all have paradoxical answers uh


so for example you know does life have


any meaning uh I could say no life is


meaningless you you arrive with nothing


you die nothing survives you you don&#39;t


remember anything as far as you&#39;re


concerned the moment you close your eyes


at last time the entire universe


disappears it&#39;s like a dream that never


happened poof no meaning


okay on the other hand I could say


actually life has infinite meaning uh


every moment is connected to every other


moment you can this it&#39;s the only thing


that actually exists uh you can ascribe


complete and utter meaning to it right


uh another question you ask is am I


alone and yeah of course you&#39;re


completely alone no one else knows your


thoughts you&#39;re single point of


awareness nobody else can have that same


point of awareness and any two points


are infinitely different in space on the


other hand it could say no of course


you&#39;re not alone the entire universe had


to conspire to to bring you here at this


moment it&#39;s all particle collisions from


The Big Bang till now and then poof here


you are and uh how can you and


everything that you do is a function of


your environment and your genes neither


of which you selected so you&#39;re not


alone you&#39;re just you&#39;re you&#39;re part of


everything you&#39;re you&#39;re indispensable


part of everything um so all of these


great questions are paradoxical answers


uh and that&#39;s one of the ways that you


know you&#39;re dealing with one of the


great questions uh and it turns out you


know if you think it through the reason


when when you see these par OES often


what you&#39;ll find is that the question is


being asked you know what is the meaning


of life but then it&#39;s being answered at


two different levels and one level is a


level of the individual separate self


which says oh the meaning is just what I


ascribe to it um and then sometimes you


answer it there&#39;s a slate of hand and


you answer it the level of the universal


self where you say well of course you


know the meaning is the universe or the


meaning is life itself um or like am I


alone if you answer that at the


individual level then the answer is yes


if you answer at the universal level the


answer is no so the paradoxical answers


come from do you choose to take do you


choose to adopt the Viewpoint of


yourself as a separate person or do you


take the Viewpoint of your spiritual


self uh and we jump between those those


contradictions very Loosely without


paying attention and we end up with


these paradoxical answers and we think


the the question is not solvable but


that&#39;s not entirely true it is solvable


it&#39;s just which level are you speaking


from so for example going back to the


Buddha a Buddha not the Buddha but a


Buddha any Buddha any enlightened person


they don&#39;t have any sense of persistent


separate self and so they&#39;re always


answering at the universal level and in


that sense they&#39;re freed of


contradictions and I think the reason we


admire those people is because we


ourselves want to be freed of this


internal contradiction uh Bor has had a


great saying that uh in every human


there is a sense that something infinite


has been lost wow and uh I love that


phrase uh because to me that&#39;s kind of


if if I think about kind of what&#39;s going


on here right I can&#39;t prove it so at the


end of the day you should figure it out


for yourself but I think what&#39;s going on


here is that there is a universal self


which is just raw awareness and that&#39;s


all there is everything in your


experience is awareness in my eyes based


on what I&#39;ve read and learned through


the show uh I feel like Hinduism


explores exactly this question what is


the infinite s yeah H Hinduism gets


closer than anybody else but any ISM


isn&#39;t going to quite get you there cuz


it&#39;s an individual thing you know the


word Hinduism is not like by modern day


Hindus we we refer to it as sanatan D


which is like the Eternal fith yeah and


what I like about Hinduism is that it


lets kind of everybody find their own


way and you can pick your God you can


pick your path it&#39;s a buffet yeah it&#39;s a


buffet and but it has to be because


there are as many paths as there are


people uh and because you create an


individual story right there&#39;s kind of


an awareness or a Consciousness


everything that you experience


experience is in this awareness it


arises in the awareness it&#39;s probably


made of awareness it&#39;s known by


awareness so what else is there


everything is intermediated through your


awareness and then on top of that you


layer your identity and your body and


your problems and your issues and your


achievements and your desires and then


eventually you unlayer all of that and


you lose that and you go back to this


undifferentiated awareness which has


kind of always been around it&#39;s


hypothesis I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true a


lot of people say it you know um and I


do read a lot of old Indian texts oh


really yeah well like I I&#39;m a fan of uh


obviously everyone says bhagad Gita but


I like the ashtavakra Gita if You&#39; read


that one uh that&#39;s yeah didn&#39;t expect


you to say that no Ash vakar is amazing


uh vista&#39;s yoga which has a lot of the


Enlightenment stories uh Herman Hesh


wrote that book sidartha which is kind


of a fictionalized Buddha story um but


you know then I&#39;ve read you know Raja


yoga and autobiography of Yogi and all


that stuff Oso Krishna MTI blah blah


blah Dello uh Michael if if it&#39;s I got


into would call Enlightenment porn and I


tracked down about a dozen of these


people in real life and I interviewed


them and I met them I spent time with


them and I meditated and I did all that


stuff but the conclusion I kind of came


to is that you got to figure it out


yourself all that stuff is inspirational


but and uh you can only kind of do it if


you want to like right now I&#39;m on


YouTube and I&#39;m watching uh old Krishna


myy talks I&#39;m watch watching papa Muji


Rupert spir uh ascendor random Youtube


videos the guy has like 10 followers but


he&#39;s enlightened the YouTube algorithm


is really good it finds Enlighten good


people if you just click around far


enough um but obviously at some level


I&#39;m not fully serious about it because


if I was serious about it I would be


there but there is a greater truth out


there again this is a bit of a


compliment to you in my eyes um you&#39;re


the definition of what a sanatani is in


terms of exploration and collecting


knowledge and then coming to a


conclusion about life and the Divine


yourself based on your own experiences


and knowledge then using the shastras


the ancient books as reference points so


that&#39;s just how I I think we all want to


know the truth and there&#39;s little truths


and there&#39;s big truths and there&#39;s


bigger truths and this is probably the


biggest truth right and I did cheat I


skipped to the end I looked at the


answer uh might have been a mistake to


be honest because the the point is not


to earn a PhD in Enlightenment actually


be enlightened right and so I don&#39;t know


exactly how you get there there doesn&#39;t


seem to be a copyable path but I&#39;m still


fascinated with it my mind is still


circling the drain on it does the


Mahabharat have any influence on your


mind I don&#39;t remember remember too well


I I think uh now this is where I&#39;m going


to just offend a lot of people but I


think that&#39;s mostly historical uh thing


obviously everything you know old Indian


mythology has a lot of uh spirituality


weaved into it but no it&#39;s not one that


I&#39;ve spent much time on okay it&#39;s more


the philosophies like the ashaka Gita


and all that yeah I love the ashaka Gita


it&#39;s incredible the song of


self-realization yeah when you&#39;re


reading that stuff yeah is there a part


of your DNA that feels stimulated being


Indian you everyone keeps trying to nail


me on this uh on being Indian


it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a very brown person


thing to do well I think I think we want


a certain pride in being Indian right


because it was stripped off because it


was stripped off I think that&#39;s exactly


right and I sort of reject that it was


stripped off really in the sense that


I&#39;m just like hey I&#39;m equally valid


right I don&#39;t consider myself inferior


to anyone I don&#39;t consider Superior to


anyone so in that sense like don&#39;t let


them strip you in the first place that


you have to then go needing it fulfill


it and and re really only the individual


can can truly transcend only the


individual can rise above whatever is


facing them um so putting your faith in


a group identity you&#39;re sort of Bound


for disappointment I mean how many


Indians are there it&#39;s over a billion


right so there&#39;s going to be as many


points of differentiation as their


commonality it&#39;s not like all billion


Indians link arm and March do the same


thing we&#39;re not we&#39;re not ants um so at


least I approach it more from an


individual level I&#39;m happy to be Indian


I have no objections with it I think


it&#39;s a rich culture uh and I think it&#39;s


you know helped me a lot and half the


books I read these days were written by


Indians you know back in the day almost


all the philosophy I read is Eastern


philosophy um and the little bit of


Western philosophy that I like uh


schopenhauer and Emerson were incredibly


and D they were incredibly influenced by


Eastern philosophy they basically just


cribed Eastern philosophy and they put


it in western words right um because


Eastern philosophy has the virtue of


being correct it&#39;s true right right uh


one side says well you know God has this


shape this skin color this size lived at


exactly this time and has exactly these


rules like skeptical you know the other


side says well you are the self that


you&#39;re looking for it&#39;s all inside of


you you have to figure it out for


yourself and you know here are some


practical steps that you can take


towards self-realization that seems more


you know that seems more correct um I


think it&#39;s an outcome of just kind of


being older like you had more time to


contemplate I think anyone who is highly


truth seeking will eventually find their


way to Eastern


philosophy uh because it has the virtue


of being true just like Western science


has the advantage of being true okay so


Western physics so when people talk


about like oh we&#39;re going to have


indigenous math no 2 plus two has to


equal four right okay we could be wrong


but I doubt it that&#39;s our best theory


right now that 2 plus 2 equals 4 so I


Look to Western for science technology


advancement by the way the East is now


starting to make strides there as well


um but when it comes to the oldest


questions the best answers are the


oldest ones like the these some of a lot


of what we&#39;ve been discussing has been


around us questions since the dawn of


mankind so and Indian civilization is


one of the oldest civilizations it&#39;s


probably the oldest large civilization


that explored these topics where we have


written materials and records and


practitioners and so on um and there&#39;s


probably more Buddhas and alive on the


Indian subcontinent than there are


anywhere else in the world so if you&#39;re


attracted to the truth of the old


questions and you want to find the old


answers you&#39;re going to head there this


is natural I think there are some


problems with traveling in India uh


namely hygiene and it&#39;s a little chaotic


but if one is ever seeking for the right


answers in life especially when it comes


to these questions India opens up


certain portals in your head it can be


influential that said if if you can&#39;t


figure something like that out exactly


where you are exactly when you are there


then it&#39;s not true the truth is not


something that&#39;s going to live in a


certain region at a certain place at a


certain time and has to be told to you


by a certain person a certain way that&#39;s


not a truth that&#39;s just another


experience uh so anything that because


the whole point of spirituality is to be


freed of the monkey mind and to be at


peace in the moment and so it can&#39;t be


reliant on anything outside it can&#39;t be


it can&#39;t it can&#39;t be in the future it


can&#39;t be in a different place uh you


know one of my problems that I have with


all religions is this idea that like oh


this is the word of God and it was p


down through this book well okay well


what if I didn&#39;t speak that language


what if I was born at the wrong time no


any fundamental truth that spiritual has


to be accessible to every human at every


time in every place regardless of


language culture religion age you know


gender whatever or even physical being


like you could be you could have mental


retardation you could be crippled you


could be dying you should still be able


to see and find and experience that same


truth on your own otherwise if it&#39;s if


it&#39;s brought to you from the outside if


it&#39;s temporal it can be taken away from


you and so I think the best path towards


truth is understanding because when you


deeply understand something um you&#39;re


not going to unand it it&#39;s the nature of


truth that once you see it once you


learn it you don&#39;t unlearn it because


it&#39;s true that&#39;s truth is indestructible


knowledge in your mind uh it can only be


replaced by a better truth it can only


be replaced by oh okay that was that


truth wasn&#39;t complete here&#39;s another


piece of the truth that I was missing um


but in that sense truth cannot be


destroyed it can only be overruled by


other truths so if you find uh some


understanding then that can be with you


forever has marriage brought further


understanding when it comes to


life I I don&#39;t marriage is fine


household is great I don&#39;t like to


discuss personal life okay I just don&#39;t


think it as relevant to other people&#39;s


lives I I will say like uh you know I


was talking about this earlier today but


my own favorite tweet uh to myself is


the you know a Fit Body a calm mind and


a house full of love these things cannot


be bought they must be earned uh and


house full of love is is that part and


you can create a house full of love


anytime you want by giving love uh that


said you know marriage is complicated


it&#39;s a negotiation uh between people you


have to learn how to live together you


have kids it&#39;s not easy uh but I&#39;m not


the person to give marital advice if


only you will agree


with it&#39;s it&#39;s too personal and every


marriage is so unique and even the


concept of marriage is sort of going


away in a lot of Western societies uh uh


I do encourage children I think children


are amazing


everyone should have kids yeah


absolutely I don&#39;t understand this


anti-natalist thing we here you&#39;re here


I&#39;m here because an unbroken chain of


our ancestors from tadpoles to monkeys


to now uh you know had children are you


going to be the first ones to miss that


Branch I mean if you believe in some


afterlife all your ancestors looking


down you&#39;re saying oh my God I can&#39;t


believe it we struggle so hard you know


we fought Tigers we we we cross


mountains we we froze during the ice


ages and this idiot just decided not to


have children cuz he couldn&#39;t be


bothered


for bad guy to stop this CH yeah he&#39;s


screwed up right but I will tell you


like if if you are older in life and you


don&#39;t have the Next Generation to look


forward to then you better find God fast


because I don&#39;t think like your own mind


and your own life will be kind to you as


you get


older you know what I&#39;ve learned about


marriage M from the outside I&#39;m not


married yet but this is conjectural okay


uh I think one&#39;s wife is always right


and and that&#39;s the rule one should


follow yeah see I reject that completely


uh yeah people say like happy wife happy


life that&#39;s all propaganda that&#39;s all


feminine propaganda you&#39;re being


brainwashed no both people have to be


equally happy uh the secret to a happy


relationship is two happy people and uh


you can&#39;t be happier than your spouse so


it&#39;s not happy wife happy life it&#39;s


unhappy wife unhappy life you know so so


you both have to be happy both of you


have to work hard to make each other


happy um you have to be a good fit and a


good match but the point of getting


married is to have children so so you


know have the kids and then you know


worst case you have kids which is still


an amazing outcome and best case you&#39;re


happily married and you have kids but I


would I don&#39;t buy the you know keep the


wife happy propaganda that&#39;s that&#39;s


that&#39;s that&#39;s letting her Sher her


duties it&#39;s been kind it&#39;s kind of you


now that that approach would work if I


asked your fiance or girlfriend and she


said Oh My Philosophy is like uh you


know keep the husband happy at all cost


if she said that then I would be like


okay that&#39;s a good match they&#39;re both


trying to keep each other happy but if


it&#39;s all one-sided no that doesn&#39;t work


yeah I mean personally I&#39;m very sanatani


yeah and sanatan D says the key to a


happy relationship is um tolerance and


selfless service so those are the two


kind of flag Poes I&#39;ve got uh after


finding the right that&#39;s good if


everybody follows it uh you know if both


people are selfless and tolerant with


each other then it&#39;ll work out well but


you&#39;re not going to be in any voluntary


relationship where you&#39;re selfless and


tolerant the other person&#39;s intolerant


and selfish it won&#39;t last so you can


only


make those kind so those are good


guidelines for society they&#39;re not


necessarily good guidelines for the


individual uh as an individual mate


selection is a real thing you have to


pick a person who you&#39;re incredibly


compatible with uh you know the


traditional model is that the you know


the man earns and creates and the woman


uh kind of takes care of the household


the man takes care of things outside she


takes care of things inside that&#39;s a


traditional model I know in the west


it&#39;s falling out of favor but it works


and in that model the man has to be


capable and do his duty and the woman


has to be kind and love loving and you


know take care of the household and so


that is a valid model of how the world


works and you can kind of I don&#39;t know


sonan or whatever you can have some


prescriptions about how to run that but


the reality is life is very complicated


every every individual is completely


unique the combinatorics of human DNA


are staggering you&#39;ll never meet two


people who are even vaguely alike if you


leave a friend you break up with a


girlfriend you lose a person in your


life a loved one you&#39;re never going to


find a substitute you&#39;re never going to


find anybody who&#39;s like the same or even


close even close right I&#39;ve never met


two human beings who are even vaguely


similar um except perhaps identical


twins but that&#39;s theoretical I don&#39;t


know any up close that well so if every


person is unique just imagine how unique


every relationship is so having other


people navigate your relationship with


hard and fast rules doesn&#39;t work you can


look to it for inspiration you can look


to it for principles but each


relationship has to work on its own


merits and I am I am a lazy person and I


hate conflict so my rule is if a


relationship has conflict I just leave


it I don&#39;t fight with people if somebody


wants to fight with me we get one fight


and then it&#39;s over because there&#39;s a lot


of people out there there&#39;s a lot of


people out there and life is long so you


have to navigate your way towards the


people who love you for who you are and


you love them the way they are nobody


needs anybody to change and if they


change it&#39;s okay because you still kind


of value the core and you change


together um the same way like you find


you have to navigate your way to the


career the job the profession the


obsession where you like the thing for


what it is the the moment is complete in


of itself as you perform that act and if


you get some reward out of it that&#39;s


fantastic but that&#39;s not the core reason


you do it um and the same way U I think


you can apply that to every facet of


your life even if you&#39;re eating you want


to find the healthy food that you


actually enjoy eating there&#39;s many


healthy foods out there just find the


ones that you enjoy eating and just


focus down on those uh for exercise find


the sport or the hobby where you it


doesn&#39;t feel like work to you like play


tennis or you know if you like running


then go run if you like lifting then go


lift if you like playing tennis then go


play tennis so I think uh the the beauty


of Modern Life is it gives us so many


options uh and that&#39;s not a bad thing


options are good uh it&#39;s just you have


to navigate your way through the options


and find out what works for you and then


commit to that and so on relationships I


don&#39;t view uh and I know this is uh


antithetical to the classical Indian way


of arranged marriage which had its


merits that was basically saying hey


let&#39;s find someone who&#39;s culturally


similar socioeconomically similar uh you


know worthy of you and the purpose of


marriage is to build a household and


have children so we&#39;ll take care of the


basics didn&#39;t always work but you know


pretty good hit rate compared to Modern


where it&#39;s just like I&#39;m going to marry


my high school sweetheart or I&#39;ll roll


the dice or oh I got this girl pregnant


accidentally and then off we go so it


can work better than some models but in


a choice-based model which is where


Western Society is and I think


increasingly Eastern Society is there um


you have to be picky uh so if you&#39;re


having to sacrifice for your SP spouse


and they&#39;re not sacrificing in return


just go somewhere else if you&#39;re in


constant conflict then both of you need


to go find someone who&#39;s you&#39;re not each


of you is not going to be in constant


conflict with and I think that&#39;s a much


better recipe that that ability to


search and to look uh and to cut your


losses quickly uh because there&#39;s High


sunk cost in these relationships the the


biggest problem in relationships is


dishonesty where we&#39;re trying to make


the other person happy we&#39;re trying to


appear our best and so for the first


year of the relationship you just fake


it you just you&#39;re just a different


person and sometimes that&#39;s just your


emotions are driving you and you&#39;re in


love so you&#39;re being on your best


behavior without even thinking about it


and sometimes it&#39;s a little more


deliberate but the reality is the longer


you fake it the worse it&#39;s going to be


because then you get trapped and now


it&#39;s sunk cost and you don&#39;t want to


walk away and breaking that relationship


is hard and your friends and family


expect you together and you can&#39;t


imagine life separately uh and now


you&#39;re stuck uh so it&#39;s just better to


be brutally honest upfront about who you


are and your needs and your worst sides


and and all of that and don&#39;t try to


throw off any Impressions because if


eventually this person will see you at


your worst and eventually you will see


them at their worst um so you might as


well just start there you know from the


outside looking in I personally have


this impression of Naval rikan the brand


and the human and I feel like nothing


hurts that guy does anything hurt you at


all uh you know I&#39;m a very paranoid


person uh so I do stress out about uh


you know um I I grew up with very little


so I&#39;m always stressed stressing over


like like politicians and money you know


like the West has now come become very


fashionable to hate money to hate wealth


to hate entrepreneurs to try to tear


people down uh We&#39;ve turned into cancel


culture right so yeah so you know those


kinds of things occasionally stress me


out um but I would say


that


um there&#39;s there&#39;s not anything I


want right need is the need is the


ultimate monkey other than knowledge


right I have not even that like what is


knowledge going to do for me I&#39;m going


to die it&#39;s all going to go to zero


anyway so it&#39;s fun I enjoy learning


things I love the aha moment when I


connect something together and I would


tweak it a little bit I would say it&#39;s


understanding not knowledge knowledge is


because knowledge gets conflated with


memorization and you know memorizing


facts and I got chat GPT for that and


the internet um so I enjoy understanding


I enjoy learning


um my my own tweet to myself on this was


spend your life in the company of


geniuses sages children and books


right those are the four things that I


enjoy the most and there&#39;s a fifth thing


a great Indian


podcaster I thought you were going to


say you&#39;re wife or a woman uh she&#39;s


gonna she&#39;s gonna nail you on this one


um I I think uh not there was there was


an old thing a story that I was liked


about Socrates where they took him into


um they took him into the quent of the


mall the market and there were all these


luxuries and fineries and and things


laid out and and Delicacies to eat and


he


said there are so many things in this


world that I do not want and I was like


oh that&#39;s power that&#39;s that&#39;s it right


there right or when Alexander the Great


met diogenes uh who was living in a


barrel uh you know Alexander was like I


wish if I came back in their life that I


could be like diogenes and diynes said


something along the lines so well if I


came back I wouldn&#39;t want to be


Alexander right so being freed from need


is the ultimate but I&#39;m not I&#39;m not a


Buddha I&#39;m not the guy who&#39;s going to


suddenly renounce everything and not


have a need uh and renunciation doesn&#39;t


work anyway uh but it&#39;s more that you


know I like games I think we all like


games we all play games we play the


social game we play the video games we


play the money games we play the fitness


game we play The Fame game we play the


love game we play the happiness game we


all play


games and I&#39;ve played a lot of games my


whole life of every kind and I&#39;ve won a


lot of games and the reason to win the


game is so you can be done with it so


you can see through it if you just keep


playing the same game over and over and


over grinding you know trying to go


higher and higher and higher maybe that


works for somebody it doesn&#39;t work for


me so I like to either see through games


or I like to be done with them so I used


to be an avid video gamer until very


recently actually this a couple of years


back maybe like five years ago I


probably spent more time playing video


games than I spent working did it do


anything for your mind it was fun uh


yeah probably I mean it was I was


playing harder than harder games and


more and more intellectual games and


strategy games and War games and


thinking games but they&#39;re just games


they&#39;re meaningless games right what was


your favorite there were so many I mean


mostly war games I was a I was a deep


war game magic the Gathering if you


remember that game you know so


anyway theic game doesn&#39;t matter the


point is I would just play lots and lots


of games and at some deep deep level I


knew they were worthless because you


know you&#39;re playing this game and then


you get some stupid reward at the end


and then they change the rules of that


game and then the game changes in like


your your reset or like you you forgot


your login or you lost it cuz you


upgraded your computer or your whatever


or this they rolled out version five


against a version four you&#39;re starting


all over right so you know it&#39;s


worthless you&#39;re just running in a


circle right and all games are worthless


because you die in the end but at least


some are longer live than others right


there are games that like for example if


I&#39;m playing the wealth creation game I


can make money which has an actual


effect on my remaining life as opposed


to just playing a video game which has


none of that benefit


I&#39;m not taking away from games games are


useful uh they&#39;re they&#39;re training for


the intellectual athlete just like


sports might be training for War for the


physical athlete um that


said I was still playing a lot of games


I knew they were kind of worthless I was


doing it to blow off steam or just


because I don&#39;t even need a reason I was


it was entertaining um but then one day


I read a blog post and uh you know truth


is that when you see it you can&#39;t unsee


it and this guy in just the right turn


of phrase he called games a shadow


career he said games are a shadow career


and I was like oh that&#39;s so good that is


so good it&#39;s like a career that you&#39;re


building that&#39;s fake you know it&#39;s a


shadow it&#39;s just going to disappear I


was like and and since that moment I


haven&#39;t been able to see games as


anything other than a waste of time so I


still do play games occasionally so once


in a blue moon mostly with my kid I&#39;ll


pick up a game I&#39;ll play for a little


bit but now I&#39;m thoroughly in completely


aware that it is a quote unquote waste


of a time and if I&#39;m okay wasting the


time it&#39;s fine but these days I&#39;m not


really okay wasting time you still play


war games with your kid uh I&#39;m going to


pick one or two up uh mostly these days


though they&#39;re on their iPads playing


their own games it&#39;s fine but what what


game would you have your kid play and I


asked this from the perspective of I


feel when I was growing up as a teenager


few games that really affected my


mindset in life FIFA uh like the


football game because it just teaches


you something about team play uh Age of


Empires obviously because you learn


strategy Sim City because you learn


Administration and Sims because you


learn about self


I mean look I I can argue for many of


them I can argue for The Sims and the


civilization type games I can argue for


board games war games uh strategy games


um the reality is even the few games I


play these days they&#39;re just like


runners or Jumpers or Fighters you know


they don&#39;t have any real meaning to them


it&#39;s fine


there&#39;s I think one of the one of my


tweets or analogies that went more viral


than others was like I really believe


that you should live your life like an


athlete or like a lion right which means


that most of your time you&#39;re resting


you&#39;re just fussing around uh you&#39;re


lazing around you&#39;re just doing whatever


you find entertaining and then once in a


while you get obsessed with something


and something is important and you just


pour everything into it so I would


rather be recharged and ready for my


next intellectual or physical Obsession


than putting myself on the grinder of I


have to wake up at this time then eat my


blueberries and then do my push-ups and


and just like live a regimented


mechanical life uh I want to live a very


free life I don&#39;t want a calendar I


don&#39;t want have to be in a specific


place at a specific time I don&#39;t want


have to answer to people um I just want


to be free and I think that&#39;s how you do


your best work and especially in an age


where we have so much leverage in the


system either through code or Media or


through other people or through Capital


the quality of your decision- making


dominates everything um Warren Buffett


is one of the richest men in the world


just because he makes a right decision


once a year and so having a clear mind


is way more important than anything else


which and this is all exuse for


laziness which just lets me relax and


relax and relax until I need to make


that decision but it&#39;s like even if I


look at my you know


um uh you know having made money in life


has happened through a bunch of


different sources but the number one was


like way bigger than the number two


through end put together two number two


was bigger than three through nend put


together three was bigger than four


through nend put together and that&#39;s


kind of how your entire life Works what


was number one if you don&#39;t mind me I&#39;m


not going to get into it but it&#39;s uh but


it it&#39;s it the compound interest applies


in all intellectual and often even in


relationship domains uh so for example


your number one relationship in your


life eventually your kids currently your


wife maybe one of your parents is going


to be more valuable to you than kind of


all the rest put together right there so


maybe not so much in relationships but


definitely in definitely in uh learning


you know your best ideas is going to be


worth more than all the rest my best


Tweets the few best Tweets you know


you&#39;re only judging your best work not


your worst so in that sense being high


output is really good current generation


May judge you on your average but the


future what&#39;ll happen is let&#39;s say you


record I don&#39;t know how many podcasts


have you recorded 800 800 great so you


know by the time you&#39;re done you&#39;ll


probably have 2,000 or something before


you&#39;re finally like okay I&#39;m bored of


this game right so let&#39;s say you have


2,000 podcasts in your life what&#39;s going


to happen is 20 of them are going to be


amazing okay and those will stand the


test of time and they&#39;ll slowly trickle


down trickle down trickle down 100 years


from now people will be watching 20 of


them and then 200 years from now 300


years from now they&#39;ll be watching one


of them right so it&#39;s you so in all of


these intellectual domains you are only


judged by your best work in posterity


which is not to say you can just


shortcut to it but most effort in life


in that sense is wasted but it&#39;s both


training wheels for the winning one plus


you just never know when or where the


right thing is going to emerge so you


kind of just have to keep moving um but


I I the thing I&#39;m not a fan of is


wasting time wasting time you know


tedious meetings with tedious people uh


you know traveling to places for for


business where there&#39;s like you don&#39;t


actually enjoy it um anything ceremonial


or ritual meetings you know complete


with of time most meetings uh just save


your time save your energy um just be


happy enjoy yourself and be and be ready


for the opportunity because there there


a time when opportunity comes and if you


yourself are rested and ready and you


find yourself interested in it then you


have the space in your life and in your


mind that you can be sucked into it um


and again without any uh desire for a


specific outcome because when you desire


for a specific outcome you&#39;re moving


away from truth seeking because now


you&#39;re looking for something and if that


thing turns out not to be true you&#39;re


going to try and force it and we can&#39;t


help it we&#39;re Desiring creatures you


wouldn&#39;t even be here on this Earth if


you weren&#39;t a Desiring creature right


you just lie there in the dirt and let


worms eat you so you are a Desiring


creature but you just have to be careful


with your desires because they will take


you away from your truth because uh true


true reasoning is UN motivated it&#39;s or


it&#39;s motivated purely by curiosity


curiosity just means you want to know


the truth that&#39;s all it is so in that


sense curiosity is the pure Mo


motivation every other motivation is


motivated reasoning and leads you to is


more likely to lead you to an incorrect


answer and then the worst thing you can


do is get through motivated reasoning


get to the falsehood and then you bake


that into your identity you identify it


with yourself you say well because I&#39;m a


Hindu or I&#39;m a Christian or I believe


this or because I&#39;m a Republican or


Democrat I believe this and then you get


locked into that now that is a part of


your understanding it&#39;s a shaky


foundation and then you start attaching


other things to that shaky Foundation


politics is a good example of this well


you know because I you know believe in


uh women&#39;s right for abortion now I also


have to believe that you know trans


women or men or men or women and I have


to believe that like you know there&#39;s no


heritability in certain things but there


is in other things I have to believe


that capitalism is evil you start


plugging all these things together that


don&#39;t actually belong together they&#39;re


voting coalitions they&#39;re coalitions of


Voters that have assemble single issue


voters but now all of a sudden you have


to adopt all of these beliefs or in


Christian you know if I&#39;m Christian then


I have to believe this and this and this


otherwise I&#39;m not a true Christian I


have to believe this and this Hindu sect


otherwise not a true Hindu all that is


nonsense one of the best lines I heard


on this was Buddha wasn&#39;t a Buddhist you


know so all the people that you admire


all the people that you look up to


they&#39;re they&#39;re not they don&#39;t strongly


self-identify with any movement you know


lean you created Singapore where we&#39;re


sitting today he didn&#39;t consider himself


Singaporean right he created that thing


so I think uh all of us are meant to not


okay not nobody&#39;s meant to do anything


but all of us function at our best when


we don&#39;t identify with anything outside


of


ourselves the one thing that this


conversation is teaching me is that uh


the universe is kind of wired to us


up a little


bit well it would have to be to be


interesting right if you could just if


it was predictable it&#39; be boring there


be no point in being here is this the


most most unserious podcast that you&#39;ve


ever done I don&#39;t


know probably maybe I don&#39;t know are you


comfortable being unserious sure yeah


I&#39;m comfortable being me I mean I was so


intimidated by the thought of speaking


to you but once I got talking to you uh


I&#39;ve just realized that you&#39;re like any


of us you&#39;ve just done the right things


consistently and you&#39;ve done the things


that you felt were easy but made a habit


out of a few other difficult things I


think if there&#39;s one thing that my


friends would say is that like I try to


figure everything out for myself I don&#39;t


listen to anybody else not even your


wife


nobody your kid nobody really yeah no


gurus no mentors no teachers no holy


this or that I mean I I definitely have


learned from people for sure I&#39;ve almost


everything I know I&#39;ve learned from


other people but I verified it for


myself is your work your Guru my work


work I don&#39;t


work you you know how you have that


saying about you choose something that


feels like play to you but work for


others oh yeah yeah yeah and I think


once you advance in that journey of play


it turns into art after a point and


that&#39;s how you look at all the products


that you invest in that they art for you


do they teach you things for life okay


whether it&#39;s in politics science


business spirituality whatever history


remembers the artists the artists are


the people who are creative and March to


their own beat and do their own thing um


great software is Art great business is


Art starting even like starting a new


country you know some level is Art


you&#39;re creating x n Hilo you&#39;re creating


something out of nothing um and uh that


to me is like the most rewarding thing


to be doing at any given time but art


can&#39;t be forced uh it can&#39;t in a sense


art is done for its own sake it&#39;s not


done for any external purpose if you&#39;re


doing it for money it&#39;s less you&#39;re


you&#39;re hurting it&#39;s uh it&#39;s cap ility to


be Arts not to say it can&#39;t still be


great art but you&#39;re just you&#39;re now


beholden to other interests it&#39;s like


motivated reasoning it&#39;s like true


scientists try to figure things out to


fulfill their desire to figure things


out right and the moment they figure it


out it&#39;s complete they don&#39;t need a


Nobel Prize or a Fields medal afterwards


and in fact some of the better ones have


rejected that or like uh famously Bob


Dylan I think rejected the pz or Prize


or whatever it was like he got some


massive prize didn&#39;t even show up didn&#39;t


even bother cuz he knows his music is


good he created for himself so I I do


think that is the highest calling


creating something for yourself because


you want to exist now nobody&#39;s perfect


we&#39;re not all going to get there um and


there&#39;s always going to be external


motivations but the less the more


internally motivated you can be the more


the thing itself is the reward um the


better the work you will do um and uh


the more F fulfilling it it is so that&#39;s


kind of what I aim for okay but maybe


that&#39;s just my excuse for being useless


these days okay


um you know again everyone views the


world with the lens that their own mind


has placed due to their own stories MH


so the lens I view the world with is


honestly pretty spiritual and I know you


don&#39;t like the word but again it&#39;s an


outcome of growing up in India in my


eyes um there&#39;s a concept of the flow


state state of flow where your best work


happens and I&#39;ve always wondered to


myself about your Flow State nal&#39;s Flow


State and for me at least based on


what&#39;s visible to the public eye it


happens when you&#39;re TW eting when you&#39;re


in one of your speet storms and it


happens when someone&#39;s asking you the


right questions and unlocking things am


I right in like yeah I mean in a flow


State your mind isn&#39;t uh obsessing with


itself it&#39;s you&#39;re not thinking about


yourself you&#39;re focused on the thing


you&#39;re focused on the activity uh it&#39;s a


meditative State it&#39;s it&#39;s a state where


like for example if you&#39;re drawing or


painting then you are the brush you are


the paint you&#39;re only thinking about


that and there is no internal chatter


you&#39;re not saying oh man you know can&#39;t


wait for dinner or I can&#39;t believe my


wife said this to me that that&#39;s all


gone and that&#39;s and you&#39;re also


operating at the edge of your capability


so it&#39;s interesting enough that you you


are being stressed you&#39;re being strained


you know you&#39;re operating at the edge


but it&#39;s not so far forward that you are


being confused or you&#39;re like obviously


screwing up um so flow state is a


wonderful thing it&#39;s it&#39;s a very


meditative State


um but probably the the shortest way to


not be in a flow state is to try to be


in a flow state right because it&#39;s again


it&#39;s that effort right so it comes much


more from you find things that you like


to do and then when you and because you


like to do something you&#39;re interested


in it you&#39;re going to get good at it


you&#39;re going to be doing it and as


you&#39;re doing it you&#39;re climbing that


ladder of uh of Mastery and any you can


climb that ladder in literally anything


um as you get more and more into it um


you&#39;re going to be more and more in flow


uh I my problem is I switch around a lot


so I fall in love with something I


obsess over it I learn everything I


possibly can about it over a couple of


months kind of period and then once I


figure the basics out 8020 I start


getting bored and then when I start


getting bored I just sort of background


it I becomes a piece of my knowledge and


understanding and then I just move on to


the next thing or I just spend time


being bored until the next thing comes


along do you think that the Flow State


sometimes allows you to channelize


knowledge


that&#39;s present


externally I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going


to say until I say it so it&#39;s kind of


funny that one of the ways that I learn


what I think is by saying it and the


same way one of the ways that I learn


what I know is by tweeting it so very


often I&#39;ll just be talking with a friend


I&#39;ll be hanging out I&#39;ll be having


dinner or I&#39;ll be sitting at home by


myself late at night and I&#39;ll just have


a thought and I&#39;ll come into my mind


almost fully baked and I&#39;m like oh I


should tweet that and then I&#39;ll tweet it


and then sometimes I have a second


thought I better changed this and


usually the first version is always the


best uh I don&#39;t know where it comes from


it&#39;s kind of interesting it comes from


Beyond whatever that means right maybe


it comes from the depths of my mind


maybe comes from somewhere else but they


come to me fully formed which is kind of


the entertaining thing I mean I&#39;m of the


belief that it comes from somewhere


else creativity is a mysterious Force


right yeah I don&#39;t know I mean that&#39;s


again I keep bringing this up man but


when I&#39;m talking to you I feel like I&#39;m


talking to Rishi you know Rishi is so uh


kind of embarrassing sorry


but that&#39;s that&#39;s what it feels like so


you know on a very Primal level the


podcast for me is based on my childhood


dream of wanting to explore the


Himalayas and have conversations with


sages and I&#39;m just like making money off


of it right now spend your life in the


company of geniuses sages children and


books right yeah but again this is one


of those things that figured through the


show whenever I speak to monks they keep


talking about the Flow State how it is


meditative it is a form of working your


mind towards Evolution but one needs to


be humble with in the Flow State and


understand that it&#39;s not their own


thoughts and creativity but it&#39;s being


placed in their head externally by the


yeah in a real Flow State you&#39;re not


thinking about yourself so it&#39;s not


coming from this look when when we self


is a very loaded word right it&#39;s another


one of the self it&#39;s another one of


these words that can mean a lot of


different things


but there&#39;s kind of the separate self


the identity the story The Character the


name the uh kind of the the emotional


predilections toward doing certain


certain things and not doing others the


reactions the memories that&#39;s the false


self okay we know that from Hinduism and


Buddhism and Hindu mythology and they&#39;ve


written it down much better than I could


ever say um that&#39;s the false self but


yet that&#39;s the self that we function


under 95% of the time and when we go


into a flow state that self quiets down


for a bit and then All That Remains is


true self which is


just I don&#39;t have a name for it maybe


you have name for it it&#39;s just the thing


that is right it&#39;s existence itself it&#39;s


Consciousness it&#39;s awareness to me


they&#39;re identical right as an aside one


of the I think I think there&#39;s a lot of


great questions out there that people


just don&#39;t ask because they&#39;re so


cliched right so uh one of the questions


I love is like if a tree falls in the


forest and there&#39;s no one around to hear


it doesn&#39;t make a sound so cliche I


think about that one all the time you


know because it really asks a question


like you know is existence and are


existence and Consciousness the same


thing like in what sense can something


be said to exist if nothing is ever


conscious of it or its or its effects um


another one that I like to think about


is the philosophical zombie problem


which is uh you know why do we even need


Consciousness why couldn&#39;t you just be


walking around reacting like an


automaton to everything and I could see


the exact same reactions the exact same


emotions and whatever but you just don&#39;t


need to be conscious why why why does


that why aren&#39;t we all just uh philosop


why aren&#39;t we all just zombies um and


actually it&#39;s funny because the Buddhist


answer to that is if you think it


through it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s not why


Consciousness the answer is why zombie


like does the zombie actually exist or


is that just a figment of the you know


awareness&#39;s imagination um another one


that I like is uh you know some of the


wisdom that&#39;s really old is so embedded


in culture we don&#39;t think about it uh


row row row your boat you know that one


row row row your boat gently down the


stream yeah it&#39;s so smart nobody thinks


about it nobody talks it&#39;s so smart


that&#39;s that&#39;s like one of the greatest


works of art ever created row row row


your boat in other words your work right


the analogy is you&#39;re sitting in a boat


you&#39;re kind of by yourself yeah there


might be other boats but you&#39;re kind of


by yourself you&#39;re rowing you got to row


you got to do some work gently down the


stream gently yeah you don&#39;t struggle


too much you know you kind of have to


figure out what you can navigate without


getting all stressed out down the stream


it&#39;s a good analogy for Life the river


you know it&#39;s going off you know it&#39;s


going to die at the end um merrily


merrily merily merily yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s


the right attitude life is but a dream


that&#39;s the cold hard truth life is but a


dream it appears it disappears it ends


Infinity on both sides right there&#39;s so


much wisdom in that little poem and


stuck around forever but instead we have


to go looking at complicated books to


figure this out as I&#39;ve learned through


the show they say that the curse of


human life is that once you die you


realize that human life was the


dream yeah I mean nobody knows what


happens when you die right that&#39;s kind


of the mystery that makes it all fun um


but you know to your point about being


attracted to like Indian


uh sort of ideals and memories I I have


found as I grow older I gravitate more


and more towards those things like um do


you mind that I&#39;m bringing it up so much


in this conv no no it&#39;s fine it&#39;s fine


anything is fine it&#39;s just a part of my


identity yeah it&#39;s fine I mean I&#39;m


Indian too by origin and probably will


end up back there at some point when I&#39;m


old enough you know I think about it I I


like India I love India these are these


are these are my brothers and sisters


right these are my people I am I am one


of them so there&#39;s a couple of places I


would love to take you to in India I


told you about one of them in the car uh


which is the mountains like Himalayas


there too many Secrets like that&#39;s where


you actually find the wisdom of the


sages and you feel it in the air the


other place is Banaras Varanasi yeah


which is in according to sanatan it&#39;s


the oldest city in the world and you do


feel that it is chaotic but there&#39;s


another part of it that&#39;s extremely


quiet there&#39;s a part of Banaras called


the manikarnika G mhm where they


perpetually burn bodies for the sake of


cremation MH mhm they say that when you


stand at the manikara and you view the


bodies burning whatever is inside you


FRS up and comes on to the outside and


that&#39;s where something inside you shifts


so for me I just became very curious and


I became more serious about this journey


of podcasting I realized that this is my


true iy guy um Japanese concept for the


sake of curiosity because you come uh


face to face with death you see human


body&#39;s burning you know if if you


actually view a human body burning at


some point the skull


explodes so when you see that happening


in front of you it shifts something


inside and I Feel Again India is


definitely not for everyone but it is


for Seekers I mean if you could keep


your death in front of you at all times


you would live a magical life then you


would value the exact moment at it&#39;s you


know as being the complete and wholesome


and only real sacred thing that exist


do you keep it death in front of you I


try to it&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t always work


but I do it&#39;s


probably it&#39;s probably the most


liberating thing that I do it&#39;s not I


don&#39;t do it as an exercise I just but it


is on my mind a lot what&#39;s an ideal


death for


you it doesn&#39;t matter hopefully not


slowly or painfully but you know it&#39;s


it&#39;s when it when it&#39;s gone it&#39;s gone I


guess the ideal would be it would be


good to be to have uh self-realized


before for that you know ultimate


truth be good I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s


such a thing that&#39;s that&#39;s Enlightenment


is not something you


necessarily from what I can tell it&#39;s


not something you necessarily find or


create it&#39;s more just unlearning it&#39;s a


shedding it&#39;s what remains when


everything else is gone so it&#39;s it is a


mini death of its own sort it is a death


of the separate self in the mind um and


I&#39;m not looking for that kind of death


but I would say I&#39;m looking for truth


and if that&#39;s true then I&#39;ll take the


truth I&#39;ll take the truth TR I&#39;ll take


an unhappy truth over a lie any day and


I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an unhappy truth


anyway but it doesn&#39;t matter I&#39;m I&#39;m


open to whatever the truth is if the


truth is oh I&#39;m just a brain and a vat


this is a simulation and someone&#39;s pting


and poking at me and they&#39;re going to


torture me for eternity fine show me the


truth I&#39;d rather know the truth you know


in The Joe Rogan episode you spoke about


how uh you used to meditate yeah and you


would just view your own thoughts You&#39;


sit in a place and just view your own


thoughts and through that process


sometimes you read Stillness but you


also had some psychedelic experiences do


you ever think about


those I kind of got bored of it um and


and I and I just I don&#39;t think


experiences are are the thing did the


distractions yes any experience that


comes will also go uh the the thing that


matters is what your state of mind is


you know at 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon


when you&#39;re sitting by yourself how do


you feel are you are you peaceful are


you happy are you good you know 2:37


p.m. you&#39;re walking down the street are


you okay how do you feel are you good


that&#39;s what matters Ms right it&#39;s the


exact moment in time what is your


internal State what is your external


State um you know what are the thoughts


that are going through your head if any


that&#39;s what matters so I don&#39;t want


Bliss for an hour a day uh that&#39;s just


another experience that comes and goes I


want I want something that&#39;s


indestructible did you ever smoke


weed uh you know I live in


California when you were younger no no


know luckily that&#39;s the kind of thing


that if I discovered in my youth I don&#39;t


think I would have had a very productive


youth because you get too into it yeah


it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s too easy to turn off


your brain I think things like weed uh


you know the the West is going through a


very hedonistic phase where it&#39;s all


about being single and partying and


doing drugs and um those are hard things


to resist they can really destroy your


sense of self-being uh I&#39;ve definitely


seen people who have done way too many


even like say for example common belief


now is that like mushrooms are harmless


right they&#39;re not I mean you do enough


of that stuff it&#39;ll break your brain


you&#39;ll end up believing too many things


that aren&#39;t real um you know same thing


with weed it&#39;ll rob you of ambition


because it&#39;s it&#39;s a very feminizing drug


it&#39;s a plant estrogen so you&#39;re just


going to sit there all day and smoke


weed and you&#39;re not going to go do


anything with your life so yes there are


definitely things that I have tried but


luckily I would say I&#39;m I I&#39;m not


getting sucked into any of them fair I


mean even water in excess is bad sure


alth that one we&#39;re pretty well evolved


for right it&#39;s just like for example if


you just from an evolutionary past if


You&#39; had access to like easy weed all


the time you would have gotten eaten by


something right you wouldn&#39;t have made


it very far um it&#39;s just in modern


society yeah we can do that modern


society is really weird where we we&#39;ve


we&#39;ve changed our physical environment


much faster than we&#39;re adapted for so we


do need all kinds of coping mechanisms


right for example we&#39;re all overfed


we&#39;re UND ex exercised uh we&#39;re


overstimulated uh our minds are worrying


about far away things right the media


the purpose of the media as I&#39;ve joked


before is to make every problem your


problem right you go on you go on social


media and it&#39;s just all dueling meme


viruses each one trying to occupy a slot


in your brain to Make You Care well you


know thousand years ago someone could


have gotten shot or blown up in some Far


Away country you would have never heard


about it you had no stake in it you had


no way of knowing about it now it&#39;s just


your brain is not man is not designed to


handle all the world&#39;s emergencies in


real time as they break it&#39;s breaking


your brain at some deep level you&#39;re not


even meant to see violence or


pornography like those are very weird


and rare and unique new things uh and so


the modern struggle is to navigate


through the fruits of


abundance uh that are wrecking you right


it&#39;s actually the


the the challenge of modernity is


avoiding the fruits of modernity right


for you have to become almost a yogi in


self-defense uh to protect yourself it&#39;s


called ver in in our culture and it


means being in the middle of a party


yeah and seeing everyone party around


you and being happy for them but not


taking part in the party yourself other


than just keeping your mind there yeah


this is why I&#39;m finding it harder and


harder to go to


parties because it&#39;s hard not to get


involved and to indulge but it&#39;s so


meaningless it&#39;s just another game right


uh and they&#39;re fun and occasionally I do


go to parties and I do like a good party


and you have a higher odds of dragging


me out to good party than to like some


tedious meeting um but all that said


like Even parties have kind of lost


their


luster what&#39;s Nal R can&#39;t like when he&#39;s


drunk or


high uh same but more talkative more


talkative more talkative yeah because


you&#39;re inherently a bit of an introvert


yes yeah got yeah on a podcast I&#39;m not


but uh left to my own devices I&#39;m very


much an inter I would much rather read


or be on the Internet or just be walking


around thinking


or you know listening to YouTube or a


podcast or something than uh hanging out


with people do you miss your


childhood


no but I don&#39;t really think about it I


don&#39;t think about the past much


consciously yeah they when you&#39;re asking


me the question I&#39;m being forced to


think about it for the first time in a


long time my bad no no there&#39;s nothing


wrong with it I&#39;m just saying I don&#39;t


think about it so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have a


I don&#39;t have a predigested answer for


you that&#39;s great yeah no but I would say


no I don&#39;t miss my childhood I don&#39;t


it&#39;s it&#39;s like a dream is it real did it


actually


happen wow there&#39;s a quote that goes


like the past is fiction it is fiction


the P the past is uh it it is a


narrative you don&#39;t remember most of it


the little bit that you do remember is


very selective memory stitched into a


narrative uh there&#39;s no point in really


remembering it uh presumably there are


lessons to learn but you probably


already digested those and learned them


you don&#39;t even have to think about those


uh so what&#39;s the


point um do you think about about the


future at


all uh I think about the future for


practical things career stuff well like


yeah if I have to make money or an


investment or if I have to like figure


out what to do with the this child and


this problem and solve that or you know


where do I want to have dinner so yeah


and that sense we are future planners


but uh I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think too far


ahead I don&#39;t I don&#39;t obsess over it but


I&#39;m more of a future creature than a


past creature for sure uh in an ideal


world I wouldn&#39;t think that much about


the future either but I&#39;m not there I


think we&#39;re forced to in order you have


to I mean you&#39;re you&#39;re a functioning


creature that has to navigate the world


but I I I I want to think about the


future as regards to utilitarian things


you know food money uh you know those


kinds of things problem solving I don&#39;t


want to think about the future in sense


of what does it hold for me like am I


going to be happy am I going to be uh in


a good relationship you know am I going


to die like the death thing is


interesting to think about you kind of


can&#39;t look away it&#39;s like the most


important thing that&#39;s going to happen


to you right so you have to think about


it but uh I I don&#39;t want to think about


I don&#39;t want to self-


obsess in the future the reason I don&#39;t


self- obsess anymore or never even got


that into it is because I just found it


both a waste of time uh as well as it


was just destroying my


happiness happiness is a big word so


more peace intruding on my peace gotcha


I think we&#39;re almost at the end of the


episode episode what advice do you have


for me I don&#39;t have advice for you I


mean you you must have gotten to know


something about me at this point or


maybe I&#39;ll ask you the career advice


aspect because I could reframe this


question as how do you view the world of


content creators going into the future I


would okay I&#39;ll give you some advice I


like I like being provocative so uh I


would say be selfish be more selfish uh


make sure you really enjoy your work


make sure you really are only working


with the people that you really like


doing like working with uh make sure you


are only have the guests on that you&#39;re


proud to have on that you genuinely want


to have conversations with um because I


I think the the value you&#39;ve already


built something of incredible value and


it&#39;s going to continue compounding so


the value now is about the longevity how


long can you keep it going whether you


go to episode a th000 or 2,000 or 5,000


matters more than uh you know you don&#39;t


want to be in grinder mode if you&#39;re


just grinding you&#39;re going to burn out


and the day you or not this thing is


over so I would say just make sure you


enjoy yourself and uh so that&#39;s part of


it uh so be selfish and make sure you


enjoy yourself and then the second part


of being selfish is talk to people where


you genuinely want to talk to them don&#39;t


don&#39;t just record a podcast or record a


podcast because you know you have to


make certain amount of money or you got


to check a box because you will be


judged at the end of the day by your


best work not by any by your average all


my content that is out there that people


like I didn&#39;t do it for them I didn&#39;t do


it for anything I didn&#39;t do it for


anyone I just did it for me and it was


deeply selfish it was just notes to self


and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that


because we&#39;re all the same inside so if


you if you&#39;re creating art then you do


it for its own sake you do it because


you enjoy it and then other people will


see the same thing that you saw in it um


and they&#39;ll get value out of it so I say


just be selfish and you can sustain it


okay now I will uh you know take the


layers off I&#39;ll take the filters off and


tell you that this was one of the


biggest days of my podcasting career man


you&#39;re very nice um you have helped me


so much from a professional perspective


being on the other side of the world and


just speaking on other podcasts and


there&#39;s so many people like me who just


sit in different parts of this globe and


consume pieces of Your Mind through


Twitter through the stuff you say on


podcast and I know you&#39;re very


nonchalant about it like you&#39;re just


enjoying it but you&#39;re adding so much


value to our lives and so many of us


have daddy issues and mommy issues and I


think Nal ravikant has become kind of a


big brother figure to people all over


the globe and to just be able to share


screen space with you is one of the


biggest honors of my life yeah at the


same time the worst thing I could do for


myself is is get into the idea of having


a fan base because uh Fame is a beast


it&#39;ll lead you alive and I don&#39;t want to


do anything for other people I don&#39;t


care about if they respect me or not


disrespect all day long who cares sh I


mean I hear you uh and you know just


observing you go about how you handle F


we were together at an event right now


it it&#39;s taught me a lot uh just sharing


I don&#39;t think I handle it well you know


I get approached by a lot of people they


want to take a photo it always kind of


weirds me out a little bit uh no it&#39;s


just it&#39;d be better not to be famous to


be honest if I had to do it over again


it might be better to be


anonymous thank God you&#39;re not


Anonymous but Nal genuinely from the


bottom of my heart I bow down to you no


don&#39;t bows please that&#39;s embarrassing PE


relationships only I I hear you but no


bows no gurus anybody calls me you want


to not be my friend call me a guru not


going to be friends I I don&#39;t think


you&#39;re a guru but you are a bit of a b


you know what bayya means brother yeah


big brother yeah so that&#39;s what I look


at you as and that&#39;s how a lot of brown


people look at you as we&#39;re all brothers


that works there&#39;s some people who just


emit that Sensei energy and it&#39;s not


their will again it&#39;s the universe


working through you that&#39;s how I look at


you so thank you for everything you&#39;ve


given all of us you&#39;re guiding a lot of


young people and you&#39;re helping everyone


with the mental and spiritual health


without knowing it thank you you&#39;re very


kind as are you 800 episodes and you&#39;re


obviously seeking bigger and bigger


truths so you&#39;re on a good path thank


you thank Youk you uh I hope we get to


speak again in life and I hope you had a


very nice time to me thank you I did


thanks for having me that was the


episode uh was not easy to make this


particular episode happen I had to to


fly to Singapore which is a 5-hour


flight away from Mumbai of course Nal


flew from halfway across the world uh


our common friend Balaji told me uh that


there is this opportunity and nal&#39;s


agreed to do this particular episode so


this was the first ever episode we shot


on foreign soil in my eyes it&#39;s the


first International episode on TRS even


though we&#39;ve shot one with Arnold


schweger in Korea we&#39;ve shot an episode


with Ronnie Coleman in India we&#39;ve shot


episode with Braun strowman in India


countless foreign cricketers but I truly


feel like my International phase of this


podcasting Journey Begins with this very


important and very iconic episode of the


ranir show couldn&#39;t sleep on the night


of this episode because this was a very


important life moment for me it&#39;s


something I&#39;ve visualized for a very


long time before we executed upon this


podcast uh dream come true for anyone


who&#39;s been listening to podcasts for the


last decade


we all know what a big deal naal


ravikant is I&#39;m just glad I got to do


this very easygoing conversation with


him and I hope that he returns on the


renv show at some point in the future I


will be attaching all his social handles


down below so for those of you who are


being introduced to him for the first


time please go follow Nel ravikant on


every social media platform I also urge


you to pick up Snippets from this


conversation and turn them into reels


and shots for social media thank you for


listening in DRS and the whole team


we&#39;ll be back very very soon
