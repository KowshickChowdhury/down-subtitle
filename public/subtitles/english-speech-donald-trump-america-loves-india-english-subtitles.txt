Namaste!
Namaste!
And hello to India.
This is such a great honor.
Let me begin by expressing my profound gratitude
to an exceptional leader, a great champion
of India.
A man who works night and day for his country
and a man I am proud to call my true friend,
Prime Minister Modi.
The first lady and I, have just traveled 8,000
miles around the globe to deliver a message
to every citizen across this nation, &#39;America
loves India, America respects India and America
will always be faithful and loyal friends
to the Indian people.&#39;
It is a profound honor to be the beautiful
new stadium to be here with you, Motera Stadium
so beautiful, and joined by so many distinguished
guests from all across your nation and all
across the world.
To the hundreds of thousands of everyday citizens
who come out and lined the streets in a stunning
display of Indian culture and kindness and
to the 125,000 people in this great stadium
today.
Thank you for the spectacular welcome to your
magnificent country.
You have done a great honor to the American
people, Milani, of my family.
We will always remember this remarkable hospitality.
We will remember it forever.
From this day on, India will always hold a
very special place in our hearts.
The life of Prime Minister Modi underscores
the limitless promise of this great nation.
He started out by his father&#39;s side as a Chaiwala,
a tea seller.
When he was a young man, he worked at a cafeteria
in this city.
Everybody loves him, but I will tell you this,
he&#39;s very tough.
Today Prime Minister Modi is the tremendously
successful leader of this vast Indian Republic.
Last year, more than 600 million people went
to the polls and gave him a landslide victory
like no other in the largest democratic election
ever held anywhere on the face of the earth.
Prime Minister Modi, you are not just the
pride of Gujarat.
You are living proof that with hard work and
devotion, Indians can accomplish anything,
anything at all anything they want.
The Prime Minister is a moving story of an
incredible rise, and so does this entire nation.
Your nation is doing so well.
We are very, very proud of India.
The story of the Indian nation is a tale of
astounding progress, a miracle of democracy,
extraordinary diversity, and above all, a
strong and noble people.
India gives hope to all of humanity.
In just 70 years, India has become an economic
giant, the largest democracy ever to exist,
and one of the most amazing nations anywhere
in the world.
Since the turn of the century, India&#39;s economy
has grown more than 6 times in size.
In a single decade, India has lifted over
270 million people out of poverty.
Under Prime Minister Modi, for the first time
in history, every village in India now has
access to electricity.
320 million people more Indians are right
now connected to the Internet.
The pace of highway construction has more
than doubled, over 70 million more households.
Think of this, 70 million more households
have access to cooking fuel.
600 million more people have access to basic
sanitation, and incredibly 12 Indian citizens
are lifted out of extreme poverty every single
minute of every single day.
India will soon be the home of the biggest
middle class anywhere in the world, and within
less than 10 years, extreme poverty in your
country is projected to completely disappear.
The potential for India is absolutely incredible.
India&#39;s rise as a prosperous and independent
nation is an example to every nation all over
the world and one of the most outstanding
achievements of our century.
It is all the more inspiring because you have
done it.
As a democratic country, you have done it,
as a peaceful country you have done it as
a tolerant country, and you have done it as
a great free country.
There is all the difference in the world between
a nation that seeks power through coercion,
intimidation, and aggression.
A nation that rises by setting its people
free and unleashing them to chase their dreams
and that is India.
This is why India&#39;s accomplishment over the
last 70 years is completely unrivaled.
No matter where you go, it is your faith in
the strength of a free society, your confidence
in your own people, your trust in your own
citizens, and your respect for the dignity
of every person that makes the United States
and India is such a natural beautiful enduring
friendship.
While our nations have many differences, they
are both defined and propelled by a fundamental
truth.
The truth that all of us are blessed with
divine light, and every person is endowed
with a sacred soul.
As the great religious teacher, Swami Vivekananda
once said, &quot;The moment I stand in reference
before every human being, and she got in him,
that moment I am free.&quot;
In America and in India, we know that we are
all born for a higher purpose to reach toward
our fullest potential, to work toward excellence
and perfection, and to give all glory to God.
Powered by this spirit, Indians and Americans
are always striving to be greater.
Our people are always seeking to be better,
and so our nations have become thriving centers
of culture and commerce and civilization.
Giving light and vitality to all of the world.
This is the country that produces nearly 2,000
movies a year from the hub of genius and creativity
known as &#39;Bollywood.&#39;
All over the planet, people take great joy
and scenes of Bhangra, music dance, romance,
and drama at classic Indian films like DD
LJ and Sholay.
This is the country where your people cheer
on some of the world&#39;s greatest cricket players
from Sachin Tendulkar to Virat Kohli.
The greatest in the world.
This is the country that built the tallest
statue on the face of the earth to my honor
the namesake of this stadium, the great Indian
patriot a native of this state, Sardar Patel.
India is the country where hundreds of billions
of light candles to celebrate the triumph
of good over evil at Diwali.
And its where just days from now Indians of
all faiths will pour out onto the streets
to celebrate the beautiful festival of Holi.
It is a country that proudly embraces freedom,
liberty, individual rights, the rule of law,
and the dignity of every human being.
Your nation has always been admired around
the earth as the place where millions upon
millions of Hindus and Muslims, and Sikhs,
and James, Buddhists, Christians, and Jews
worship side-by-side in harmony.
Where you speak more than 100 languages and
come from more than two dozen states yet,
you have always stood strong as one great
Indian nation.
Your unity is an inspiration to the world.
In America, we have come to know the splendor
of Indian culture personally through the four
million Indian Americans living in the United
States.
As our wonderful friends, colleagues, and
neighbors, they are truly spectacular people.
Indian Americans enrich every aspect of our
national life.
They are Titans of business, the biggest the
best, pioneers of science, masters of the
art and innovation of technology like few
people have been able to see no matter where
you go anywhere in this universe.
Nearly one in four Indian Americans trace
their roots right here in Gujarat.
Gujarat is a special place.
So, on behalf of the entire American people,
thank you, and thank you all for the contributions
your culture traditions have made to my beloved
country.
The Prime Minister and I will also continue
our important discussions about how to deepen
the relationship between our two great countries.
Both of us understand that when leaders put
the interests of their own citizens first,
we can forge strong and fair partnerships
to build a safer and more prosperous world.
Just months ago, this critical partnership
took a major step forward when the US military
and your brave Indian Armed Forces conducted
the first-ever air land and sea military exercises
between our two countries.
It was something to behold.
We called it Tiger Triumph.
As we continue to build our defense cooperation,
the United States looks forward to providing
India with some of the best and most feared
military equipment on the planet.
We make the greatest weapons ever made.
Airplanes, missiles, rockets, ships.
We make the best, and we&#39;re dealing now with
India.
But this includes advanced air defense systems
and armed and unarmed aerial vehicles.
I am pleased to announce that tomorrow our
representatives will sign deals to sell over
$3 billion in the absolute finest state-of-the-art
military helicopters and other equipment to
the Indian Armed Forces.
I believe that the United States should be
India&#39;s premier defense partner, and that&#39;s
the way it&#39;s working out.
Together, we will defend our sovereignty security
and protect a free and open Indo Pacific region
for our children and, for many, many generations
to come.
We are in the early stages of discussion for
an incredible trade agreement to reduce barriers
of investment between the United States and
India.
I am optimistic that working together the
Prime Minister and I can reach a fantastic
deal, that&#39;s good and even great for both
of our countries.
Except that he&#39;s a very tough negotiator.
Since my inauguration, commerce between our
two nations has increased by more than 40%.
India is now a major market for American exports,
and the United States is India&#39;s largest export
market.
A booming America is a great thing for India,
and it&#39;s great for the world.
And that&#39;s why we&#39;re so happy to announce
that we have had the greatest economy ever
in the history of the United States.
In America, we have proven that the best way
to attract jobs and opportunity is to reduce
burdens on business, knocked out barriers
to new investment, and eliminate unnecessary
bureaucracy red tape regulation and taxes.
Prime Minister Modi has already made significant
reforms here in your country, as you very
well know.
The world looks forward to even more rapid
improvement to India&#39;s business climate under
his leadership.
He wants to do it, and he&#39;s doing it at a
record pace.
2 years ago, Prime Minister Modi warmly welcomed
my daughter Ivanka to the Global Entrepreneurship
Summit in Hyderabad, and she is back with
us today, Ivanka thank you, thank you for
being here.
We are delighted to be joined as well by dozens
of Indian women entrepreneurs who are helping
to build your nation&#39;s future.
They are great and natural entrepreneurs.
And I just say to the men, be very careful
they&#39;re really good.
The United States and India are also working
closely together on the future of space exploration.
You are making impressive strides with your
exciting Chandrayaan Lunar program.
It is moving along rapidly far ahead of schedule
in America looks forward to expanding our
space cooperation.
Within India, as you push even further, you
are pushing the limits, and that&#39;s a great
thing including in the realm of Human Spaceflight.
The United States and India will be friends
and partners on our voyage into the Stars
and into space.
It is truly extraordinary what this nation
has achieved in the span of just one lifetime.
What they have done under the leadership of
Prime Minister Modi, it is absolutely incredible.
Mr. Prime Minister congratulations.
You have come so far, but it is nothing compared
to with how far India will go into the future.
And the Prime Minister is laying the foundations
for a future like few other countries can
even think of.
This nation is blessed with many treasures,
from the sacred banks of the Ganges to the
golden temple and the Jamia Masjid.
It is the home to some of the most cherished
cultural heritage anywhere on earth.
It is also the land of stunning vestas and
astounding natural wonders, from the rugged
peaks of the Himalayas to the splendid shores
of Goa.
India has always been a wellspring of deep
wisdom and great ideas from the vestas and
the ancient epics all the way to the modern
Indian nation.
But standing before all of you today, I know
that true strength of India is not found in
its textbooks, its landmarks, or its landscapes.
The true strength of India is found in 125,000
beating hearts in this stadium and the millions
and millions of people who have seen and witness
great friendship and admiration today.
It is all found in the soul and the spirit
of the Indian people.
Your courage won and secured this nation&#39;s
independence.
Your devotion built this great and enduring
democracy.
It is your dreams that will power this country
to a future, even greater progress, prosperity,
equality, and opportunity for every citizen
across your land.
So, today I say to every Indian, North and
South, Hindu and Muslim, Jewish and Christian,
rich and poor, young and old, take pride in
the glories of your past.
Unite for an even brighter future and let
our two nations always stand together as powerful
defenders of peace and liberty and the hope
of a better world for all of humanity.
Thank you again, Prime Minister Modi, for
your hospitality, and thank you, India, for
this phenomenal welcome.
I want to just leave by saying God bless India;
God bless the United States of America.
We love you; we love you, India very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
