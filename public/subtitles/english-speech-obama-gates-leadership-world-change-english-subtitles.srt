I&#39;m sorry guys that&#39;s not going to work


if you want to get done what you&#39;re


talking about you will have to combine


effective philanthropy and Technical


know-how and smart policy engineering


with getting your hands dirty


trying to change public opinion and


trying to ensure that


the people who are in charge of the


levers of power


are responsive talk to us a little bit


about how you think of movements around


the world and the power of those now and


what leaders can learn from them well


no I I&#39;d make a couple of observations


number one is that


uh most big change most human progress


is driven by


young people who


don&#39;t know any better and figure why


can&#39;t we do something different


let&#39;s hold people uh


get comfortable or cranky uh or


protective of their


status or set in their ways there&#39;s a


reason why if you look at for example


here in the United States the Civil


Rights Movement the leaders of those


movements were in their 20s Dr King was


26 when he started 39 when he was killed


and if you if you canvassed the world


oftentimes that is the the impetus uh


people asking uh and


in ways that uh I think are familiar to


many not


um


why not but or not why but why not uh


why do things have to be the way they


are so so that&#39;s Point number one that


the young people I think uh can make an


enormous difference number two


is


that


because most of us now


either live in democracies or


countries that purport to be democracies


because


we we have one


the uh the Battle of ideas that says


governments and are are common efforts


uh have to be rooted in the legitimacy


of people


there is more power than ever


in


people being able to band together and


collectively


uh push for initiatives that are going


to make change in their lives that&#39;s


uh something that for most of human


history was unimaginable that is one of


the amazing transitions that has taken


place and you will notice that even in


autocracies today


there is


the


at least the


pretense of democracy because people


believe that governments that are rooted


in people are more legitimate and we


that&#39;s a battle we won and now have to


make real wherever we can that&#39;s Point


number two point number three


uh is


simple math


in most places if you want to get


something done whether it&#39;s a smarter


climate change policy or


uh health care for people or


more funding for girls education


you&#39;ve got to have


a majority of people supporting it you


got to have votes you have to have


the allocation of resources and that


requires mobilization and a game of


addition rather than subtraction


so uh and and the fourth point I would


make would be the internet now has


turbocharged the capacity for us to


develop movements in ways that we had


not imagined before now the last thing


I&#39;ll say so that I don&#39;t sound like I&#39;m


in the still in the U.S Senate and


filibustering


uh it is is


I guess a smaller uh point but a


profound one that I tried to reinforce


with my staff at every level of my


public work and and continue to do to


this day I actually think


organizing mobilizing


starting movements uh starts with a


story


and


you can&#39;t create a story that moves


large numbers of people unless you are


able to listen and hear to the story of


the person next to you


uh the story of your neighbors the


stories of your co-workers the stories


of your community


the story of people who are not like you


and so uh one of one of the things that


I think is is important is for us to


learn how to


uh listen to each other and learn


how it is that we came to be who we are


I think uh the way we do


um because that understanding of other


people&#39;s stories is how you end up


ultimately uh forging bonds and creating


the glue that creates movements


um you know every great movement if you


think about Gandhi in in India it


started with his understanding of


India&#39;s story and his own story and


seeing Indians in South Africa


discriminated against and recognizing


that there were traditions and myths and


a power in those stories that ended up


um


driving out the most powerful Empire


on Earth


um it wasn&#39;t guns and increasingly that


will be the case and certainly that will


be the case if we&#39;re able if we want to


move forward uh the uh sustainable


development goals that we&#39;re talking


about is we&#39;ve got to be able to tell a


story


uh not only to


big donors or politicians but also to


for example


people here in the United States who may


feel like look I&#39;ve got my own problems


why should I be worrying about somebody


on the other side of the world


you have to say when we


got into philanthrians uh particularly


study Global Health we were stunned at


the progress we had we&#39;d had no idea and


it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of amazing if you ask


even very well-educated people uh you


know what&#39;s happened with vaccination


what&#39;s happened with uh uh HIV


they don&#39;t know the the positive story


and a little bit the news is always


going to focus on the setbacks uh


because that&#39;s what happened that day


the gradual progress doesn&#39;t fit that


Paradigm and even people who raise money


for these causes I have to say you know


sometimes even some of the material we


create is talking about the peace that


remains as though


uh it it it&#39;s never improved do you have


any thoughts on how we get this more


positive sense of progress going and


what uh how we would get that word out


well look uh


you&#39;re talking to somebody who who for


seven years tried to get the word access


and


nobody at least


about 40 percent of the country didn&#39;t


believe me


until I was gone and then suddenly they


believed it so


uh


so so with that caveat uh


yeah I I&#39;d make a couple observations


one you&#39;re right Bill there is the the


nature of the media and maybe just the


human brain is to fasten on what&#39;s wrong


not on what&#39;s right and I&#39;m not sure


we&#39;re going to be able to change that


right visual


displays of


a fire


uh are much more interesting than just a


building sitting there and so the fire


is going to make the news the building&#39;s


sitting there nicely and people are


walking their dogs in front of and stuff


that will not make the news


um


so so I don&#39;t think that we can count on


conventional media necessarily to spread


the word uh


this is though where the power of


uh


the internet has not I think been


harnessed the way it needs to be


particularly when we think about young


people and young audiences uh Malia and


Sasha consume information differently


than I do and I think that those of us


who&#39;ve been involved with policy work


are still putting out these reports with


pie charts and this and that and


that&#39;s not interesting to them


um but stories


and visual representations of progress


can go viral there&#39;s a hunger for it


uh it&#39;s just that we don&#39;t


systematically think about it and and so


I think when the three of us were


talking a while back I mentioned that


one of one of the areas that I&#39;m deeply


interested in is how do we build


um


sort of a a digital platform whereby


people can go to find out


what&#39;s happening that is moving the


progress on issues and then activates


them because I heard somebody I think


maybe Trevor saying a an important Point


wanna I&#39;m very interested in how online


communities can move offline


uh how this incredible power to convene


through


hashtags and tweets and this and that


and the other eventually leads to people


meeting each other and talking to each


other and I I think that we have not


fully tapped


that as a way of spreading the word


about progress that has been made


uh I also think it is important for us


to put some uh friendly pressure on


leaders to tell good stories


and to make sure that


we don&#39;t


uh


that that we aren&#39;t so rigid in our


partisanship or ideologies that we are


not willing to acknowledge and share


when somebody who might be of a


different political persuasion


has done something really good even if


it runs contrary to


uh our short-term political interests I


I mean I always used to say


uh as as big as the differences were


between me and my pres uh predecessor uh


George W bush


that uh what his administration


initiated with pepfar


was a


singularly important achievement that we


needed to sustain and build up and uh


I didn&#39;t think that&#39;s somehow detracted


for me to say


that somebody from another political


party did something really smart and


really good and deserved credit for it


um and and I feel as if these days


uh with within our political circles


that&#39;s a hard thing uh for people to


bring themselves to do


one of the things that bill and I had


the great privilege of doing when you


were in the White House late in your


presidency was spending a little bit of


casual time on a Saturday night and your


daughters were in and out of your home


Malia and Sasha and you&#39;ve been to our


house earlier this summer and saw Rory


and Phoebe two of our three in and out


of our house our daughter Jen is here in


the front row tell me about Jen&#39;s like


thanks Mom yeah I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s our job


to embarrass you yeah


but you know Jen&#39;s about the age of your


girl&#39;s a little bit older but how have


you and Michelle thought about talking


to your children about being leaders in


the world and taking up this mantle of


what needs to be done in the world well


it


what we&#39;ve tried to communicate their


entire lives is


that


each of us has responsibilities


um


when they were small the


responsibilities were small mike


say when you want to go potty and then


uh


as you get older your responsibilities


grow


uh and and but but part of what we I


think try to communicate is is that


um


being responsible is is an enormous


privilege that&#39;s what marks you as


uh a fully grown human is that you


that other people rely on you that you


have influence that you can make your


mark bad if you do something well that


that will improve other people&#39;s lives


that


uh the kinds of values that we&#39;ve tried


to instill


many of them your basic home spun values


like kindness and


consideration and empathy and hard work


that those


um are


are tools by which you can shape the


world around you in in a way that feels


good uh and


so what we&#39;ve what we&#39;ve tried to


encourage is


that the sense that


um


it&#39;s not somebody else&#39;s job it&#39;s your


job


and I think that is that that&#39;s a ethic


that they&#39;ve embraced uh now they will


choose to participate in in different


ways because they have different


temperaments different strengths I think


one of the mistakes that we sometimes


make is to think that there&#39;s just one


way of making a difference or being


involved uh you know if you are a


brilliant engineer


uh you don&#39;t have to


make a speech


you can create an app that allows an


amplification or the scaling up of


some something that


is really powerful uh if if you are


somebody who who likes to care for


people


uh you you don&#39;t have to


uh go out and


um lead the protest March you can


Mentor some kids uh or


work at a at a local Health Clinic that


is going to make a difference so so


there are a lot of different ways in


which to make a contribution and we try


to emphasize that uh that to them as


well and then the third thing that we


try to try to encourage is


uh what I mentioned in my earlier


remarks which is that uh you have to be


persistent


I I


I I always tell people that


my my early work as a community


organizer in Chicago


uh


taught me an incredible amount but I


didn&#39;t set the world on fire uh you know


I I got some


public parks uh for communities that


needed them I started some after school


programs we we helped set up a job


training program for people who had been


laid off of work but


that


those communities weren&#39;t suddenly


transformed they still had huge problems


um


but I took that experience and then I


was able to build on it


and


I think so often we get impatient


because change does not look


as if


uh so sometimes it&#39;s not as discernible


or immediate or impactful as we had


imagined in our in our minds and we get


disappointed and we get frustrated Bill


did you have one last question yeah


so this week uh part of the reason we&#39;re


all in New York is the United Nations is


meeting and you know some of these


Global institutions were created right


after World War II uh World Bank World


Health Organization UNICEF they&#39;ve been


key Partners uh for many of these causes


and yet there is definitely a cynicism


about their bureaucracy their efficiency


and their ability to change in fact


um very few exceptions like Global fund


and gobby we haven&#39;t had any new ones so


over the next 10 or 20 years do you


think these Global institutions in terms


of Reform or creating new ones if for


pandemics and climate change can they


step up to play the role we need them to


play


well


let me first of all say that


the biggest problems we confront


no one nation is going to be able to


solve on its own not even a nation as


powerful as the United States of America


um there are times during my presidency


where I was attacked for not


uh claiming that we could go on our own


um as if that was an expression of


weakness no I


I I believe that the United States is in


fact an indispensable Nation


uh and that many of the initiatives and


much of the progress that we&#39;ve made


could not have been done unless we


underwrote those efforts uh and I&#39;ll use


as an example of our handling of Ebola


uh which


in


retrospect


I think a lot of


historians would argue was one of the if


not the most effective emergency Public


Health intervention in history


we we had to create the architecture and


the infrastructure


and send our military in to create


runways where the Chinese could then


land planes to deliver goods and we had


to provide guarantees to the Europeans


so that


if they sent health workers they could


feel some assurance that uh they could


be medevaced out if they got uh infected


so


so I take great pride in what the United


States can do but if we&#39;re talking about


climate change or


uh


global migration spurred on by


uh


drought or famine


or


you know ethnic conflicts


we&#39;re not going to be able to solve


those things by ourselves and as you as


you indicated don&#39;t


some if we get an Airborne pandemic


uh unlike a slow-moving slow uh


diseases difficult to transmit like


Ebola


if if we haven&#39;t built ahead of time


some


some structures to deal with this


millions of people could be adversely


impacted so uh


so number one you have to start with the


premise and believe that multilateral


institutions and efforts are important


and you don&#39;t have to seed all your


sovereignty or it doesn&#39;t make you less


patriotic to believe that you just have


to


have some sense


and read


um so that&#39;s Point number one point


number two


is that uh in fact


um there are problems with existing uh


multilateral institutions not


surprisingly they were designed


post-world War II for the most part and


they couldn&#39;t have anticipated


everything that&#39;s happened


uh there is bureaucracy and inertia and


resistance to reform


so it is important for


every country


every leader


to be honest about the need for reform


and not simply think narrowly about well


I want to keep certain numbers of slots


or votes or this or that


at least on many of the issues where


there shouldn&#39;t be a big ideological


controversy look reforming


the security Council


that&#39;s something that goes to core


geopolitical interests and is a huge


difficult and perhaps uh


uh unachievable goal anytime soon


on the other hand making sure that the


who works well


and that we have


a sufficient security


trigger when a pandemic or something


else happens that is achievable and it


shouldn&#39;t be controversial it&#39;s just a


matter of digging in and getting the


work done


when it comes to girls education


there may be cultural resistance in some


places to actually getting it done


but generally speaking there&#39;s not


a there aren&#39;t that many folks who will


explicitly say I&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t want


to educate our girls and women as a


practical matter they may


you may see that in in certain countries


but at the level of our multilateral


institutions there should be a broad


consensus and so what what I would hope


for is that


we come up with concrete plans


in those areas


oftentimes with respect to uh the the


sustainable development goals are areas


where there is a consensus on at least


the aims if not always the means and


think about how can we improve Delivery


Systems how can we improve their


operations on a day-to-day basis but


ultimately


the last point I would make that


requires


leaders to feel as if it matters and is


important


that in turn requires


the public


think that it matters and is important


because unfortunately what you discover


is is that most politicians and elected


leaders are followers and not leaders


they they see what do their


constituencies care about and they


respond


and one of the biggest challenges that


we&#39;ve had is that


um and and I speak most intimately about


the United States


uh


the General Public


responds with enormous generosity


when they see a specific story of a


child


uh who&#39;s hungry or somebody who&#39;s been


stricken by uh


you know a flood


but when it comes to just a general


knowledge or interest in


development funding


not only do they not know much


but


they oftentimes have a negative reaction


because their view is we&#39;ve got a lot of


needs here at home why are we sending


money overseas sadly it is one of the


areas the only areas where Democrats and


Republicans agree in this in the United


States is on fornate


and repeatedly you&#39;ve seen


uh public opinion surveys where people


wildly overestimate what we spend on


foreign aid they think 25 percent of the


federal budget is going to foreign aid


and helping


uh people other than folks in their


towns and their communities so the need


for public education


in the ways we talked about that promote


that that tell a good story


that point out that this is actually a


bargain


that connect what we do with respect to


development to security not in in a


perfect correlation but to say that look


if you&#39;ve got failed States


then generally


some of that&#39;s going to spill over on us


if you have economies that are failing


ironically if you are concerned about


immigration and mass migration


it&#39;s really a good investment to make


countries work so that people can eat


because then


it&#39;s not like they&#39;re dying to get on a


dinghy and Float across an ocean uh if


the place the country where they were


born and they loved was functioning so


so uh thinking about ways in which we


describe this


both as


an economic imperative


a environmental imperative


a security imperative


um


the more we can influence public opinion


the more you&#39;ll see politicians respond


uh that doesn&#39;t mean that there is not


enormous role to play for ngos


philanthropy and so forth but I and I&#39;ve


said this to both Bill and Melinda


um


even with the incredible generosity and


enormous skill with which they&#39;ve


deployed


uh their their resources over the years


the US budget&#39;s still bigger absolutely


a lot a lot bigger and a lot you know


this this notion that you can that I


hear sometimes from young people that


you can work around government


and work around politics because that&#39;s


too messy or it&#39;s corrupt or it&#39;s you


know I I just don&#39;t like those folks or


what have you uh I&#39;m sorry guys that&#39;s


not gonna work


if you want to get done what you&#39;re


talking about you will have to combine


effective philanthropy and Technical


know-how and uh you know smart policy


engineering with getting your hands


dirty


trying to change public opinion and


trying to ensure that


the people who are in charge of the


levers of power


are responsive and and that will require


work and I guarantee you you will be


disappointed at points


um but


um


what a glorious thing it is to


be responsible for saving the world


that&#39;s your responsibility


that are next
